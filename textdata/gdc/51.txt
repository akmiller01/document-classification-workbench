How t o Ensure  Children Are Effec tive Digital Citizens Equipped t o Engage Safely Online  
For consideration to include in the Global Digital Compact  
In the more than 30 years since the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by the 
United Nations General Assembly (1989), the implementation and advancement of children’s 
rights through the Convention and its Optional Protocols have provided the foundation for 
improving the li ves of millions of children globally.  
Children, recognized as individual rights -holders, are guaranteed the right to special protections 
and safeguards from the duty -bearers in their communities.  
While the Convention highlights the enduring international s tandards for ensuring the realization 
of the rights of every child, we recognize that with evolving digitalization  and communication 
technologies the protocols to ensure the safety, well -being and empowerment of children must 
be updated/ modernized.  The Global Digital Compact is of great significance due to i ts goal 
to “outline shared principles for an open, free and secure digital future for all .” 
Children account for an estimated one -third of all Internet users, with millions more dependent 
on online systems and platforms tha t provide essential access for social and educational 
interactions. T he COVID -19 pandemic further  magnified  the existing digital divide created by 
economic gaps and lack of access to digital technology and tools.  
Noting that Genera l Comment No. 25 on children’s rights in relation to the digital environment , 
adopted by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in March 2021, presents the challenges, 
risks, opportunities , and recommendations for children to engage safely o nline , ChildF und 
Alliance calls for the following commitments to be included  in the Global Digital 
Compact : 
 Make explicit mention of “children” as a distinct group of human beings and rights -holders 
within society – so that children’s specific needs are taken into acco unt in the formulation 
of policies and legislation —both of which i mpact children in very specific and different 
ways than adults;  
 Create a safe digital environment where children are able to acquire skills, lear n, and 
share ideas with their peers and  duty bearers through civic engag ement  and specific 
channels of participation designed for children  and with children ; 
 Listen to and consider the broadest and most inclusive representation of children’s 
voices, opinions and solutions , and meaningfully include children in the design, delivery 
and evaluation of legislation, policies,  products and services that impa ct their safety and 
the realization of their rights in the digital environment;  
 Provide all child ren from an early age with h igh quality online and offline digital literacy 
resources and education adapted to their age and diverse abilities, including in school 
curricula, parenting programs, early childhood development programs , and prog rams for 
out-of-school children . This is to help develop children’s digital skills ; facilitate their 

2 
 autonomous and safe use of digital tools including mitigating risk ; support their 
development as active and responsible citizens in an increasing ly digital society ; and 
increase  their own understan ding of online safety, their rights, and the complaints 
mechanisms and support services available to them in case  of violations of these rights;  
 Provide parents, caregivers  and educators with  information and support to use digital 
tools so that they can be tter help their children safely and effec tively navigate the 
Internet as well as  understand and realize their rights while  simultaneously  limiting th eir 
exposure to harmful content;   
 Increase the development of child rights -respecting parental control tool s installed by 
default on devices and operating systems, while incorporating safety and privacy by 
design p roducts into digital platforms;  
 Support greater transparency fr om major digital platforms regarding  their internal efforts 
to identify, prev ent, and respond to online harm and violence that  children may experience 
by using their services . This includes through the publication of annual reports conducted 
by independent third -party entitie s that outline how platforms identify and assess risks,  
and what  their mitigation strategies  are to address these risks  and prevent their 
reemergence in the future ; and 
 Encourage creation and access to high -quality, reliable content, including information 
content while addressing manipulations of information  (such as “fa ke news”)  and 
supporting greater transparency from major digital platforms with regard to their content 
selection, moderation and distribution methods, the data gath ered, and its use.  
Further, ChildFund Alliance urges for inclusion in the Global Digital Compact the following 
calls to stakeholders:  
 We call on all governments, intergovernmental organizations, the United Nations, the 
private sector, International Non -Governmental Organizations and other relevant 
organizations  to protect children’s rights in the digital environment, and to make their 
safety and security in this environment a priority;  
 We call on governments to provide each child with effective, affordable, easily accessible, 
meaningful, and reliable access to t he Internet , essential digital tools, accessible and 
inclusive public and digital health services, online learning and virtual vocational training . 
These will help bridge digital divides, including gender and socio -economic digital divides, 
within and betw een countries, with particular attention paid to children in vulnerable 
situations , and encourage the healthy development of their cognitive and digital skills while 
avoiding over -exposure to screens at a young age;  
 We call on governments to provide age -appropriate digital literacy and digital citizenship 
training, giving special attention to preventing and eradicating digital sex c rimes against 
underage children;  
 We call on governments to advocate  for girls' digital education in the least -developed and 
conflict-affected countries to achieve digital educa tion equity and gender equality;  
 We call on governments to collaborate with private sector stakeholders, specifically 
technology companies and  service providers, as well as civil society to develop mandatory  
codes  for the online/digital space  based on international best practice s in order to prevent 
abuses and address gaps in the protection  of children . Such codes should take into 
account children’s rights and safety when products and internal policies are designed  and 
implemented, or when updated and modified. They should also meaningfully include 
children in the creation and evaluation processes to help mitigate online harms, including 
3 
 technology -facilitated grooming, online sexual exploitation and abuse, ex posure to age -
inappropriate, harmful and untrustworthy content, as well as excessive use;  
 We call on governments to foster relevant collaboration between law enforcement and the 
private sector , specifically technology companies and  service providers . We call on the m 
to proactively conduct child rights due diligence, expedite the identification of and the 
immediate and effective removal of child sexual abuse or cyber harassment material 
through transparent processes ; immediately report identified materials  to appropriate 
authorities ; and address the ways in which uses of digital technologies may facilitate or 
impede the investigation and prosecution of crimes against children, while fully upholding  
international human rights law;  
 We call on governments to p rovide free, inclusive, accessible, victim -centered and trauma -
informed support services to victims and survivors of child sexua l exploitation and sexual 
abuse – be it offline or online  –, including physical and mental health, cou nseling, case 
management, legal  and housing services. Further, governments should allocate adequate 
resources for young people to develop life skills and practical strategies to navigate their 
healing process and support self -advocacy;  
 We call on governments  to regularly consult wi th survivors of child sexual exploitation and 
sexual abuse, including through the establishment of survivors’ councils, and meaningfully 
consider survivors’ experiences, ideas and solutions in the development and evaluation 
of relevant legislation, p olicie s, products  and services;  
 We call on governments and the private sector, specifically technology companies and  
service providers , to c ommit to fight against any form of economic exploitation, including 
child labor – online and offline – and thereby  to exer cise the utmost vigilance regarding 
new and emerging  forms of forced child l abor in the digital environment;  
 We call on governments and the private sector, specifically technology companies and  
service providers , to convene deliberations regarding the next  version of the internet 
(“internet 2.0”) . Specifically, we urge governments and the private sector to devise and 
implement clear rules, regulations and  guardrails for the internet 2.0  – whether that be the 
metaverse, virtual reality (VR), or a mix of thes e and/or other innovations. This is to ensure 
that protections are put in place proactively to reduce the risks of bias, digital violence and 
other forms of  online  abuse. In doing so, regulators and private industry would be  tackling  
these risks proactivel y – at this critical point in time when the next version of the internet 
is still in its developmental stage. If this  does not happen, the world will most likely  find 
itself in the same situation as it does with today’s internet – namely scrambling  reactiv ely 
for ways to protect human being s (especially women, girls and boys) from online violence;  
 We call on governments, the private sector and other key stakeholders to protect 
children from online harm by safeguarding privacy and preventing and responding to 
sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as other forms of violence, i ncluding physical,  
mental  and psychosocial violence, bullying and targeted hate speech ; 
 We call on governments, the private sector and other actors to employ a child rights and 
participatory approach  to data collection, protection  and management, as well as 
strengthening child -sensitive indicators and increasing the disaggregation of data by sex, 
gende r identity, age, and disability;  
 We call on governments to promote girls’ a ccess to digital tools and digital educational 
opportunities from an early age – to close the gend er-related digital divide and combat 
gender -based prejudices  that discourage and prevent them from accessing technology, 
studying ICT , or pursuing or exerci sing digital technology careers; and  
 We call on governments and the private sector to address exploitative digital marketing 
practices that violate children’s right to privacy.
