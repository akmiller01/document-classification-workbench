Background  
In September 2020, on the commemoration of the seven ty-fifth anniversary of the United 
Nations, member states adopted a political declaration , Guided by the Charter on how they 
are going to ensure the future they w ant and the United Nations they need. Consequently, 
in September 2021 the UN Secretary -General published his report entitled “ Our Commo n 
Agenda ,” which proposes a Global Digital Compact (hereinafter ‘GDC’) that seeks to 
“outline shared principles for an open, free and secure digital future for all.” The proposed 
Global Digital Compact is set to be agreed  upon at the Summit of the Future  in September 
2024.  
 
It is against this background that the Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and 
Communication and Bangladesh Internet Governance Forum would like to organise 
consultations and roundtable on the Global Digital Compact aimed to provide a forum to 
discuss how th e future GDC can facilitate the use of digital technologies for the realisation 
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and enhance digital access for societies 
across the country and provide an opportunity for various stakeholders to input into the  
GDC.  
 
The consultations further aimed to enable discussions about how risks and challenges 
associated with new technologies can be addressed by anchoring principles for responsible 
use inside the GDC.

of the multi -stakeholder and leads its engagement on a wide range of policies and 
programs with the highest levels of the U.N., governments, media, academia, and civi l 
society actors about ICT4D.  
 
BNNRC’s intervention has been successfully aligned with the UN World Summit on the 
Information Society (WSIS) process since 2000. Recognizing the importance of the 
BNNRC intervention, BNNRC was recognized by the UN World Summ it on the 
Information Society for the 7th time as a winner and champion.  
 
The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), held in two phases in Geneva in 
2003 and Tunis in 2005, set out a clear vision to harness the vast potential of information 
and communication technologies (ICTs) to achieve the development aspirations of all the 
world’s inhabitants. Recognizing the importance of ICT as a valuable asset for economic 
growth, world leaders expressed their strong political commitment to  building an 
inclusive, people -centred and development -oriented information society.

divide into a digital opportunity for all in Bangladesh.  
 
 Since Geneva in 20 03 and Tunis in the 2005 summit, governments and stakeholders have 
undertaken many initiatives and consultations to bridge the digital divide in line with the 
UN WSIS agenda.

Bangladesh Internet Governance For um (IGF) 2006: UN Internet Governance 
Forum (IGF) as an outcome of the UN WSIS  
 
UN Internet Governance Forum (IGF) as an outcome of WSIS.  Internet governance was 
one of the most controversial issues during the first phase of the World Summit on the 
Inform ation Society (WSIS -I), held in Geneva in December 2003.  
 
 It was recognized that understanding Internet governance was essential in achieving the 
development goals of the Geneva Plan of Action but defining the term and understanding 
the roles and respons ibilities of the different stakeholders involved proved to be difficult. 
WSIS -II requested the UN Secretary -General to convene an Internet Governance Forum, 
as a multilateral, multistakeholder, democratic and transparent platform for discussions 
on Interne t governance issues.  
 
 According to the UN IGF mandate, BNNRC co -founds the Bangladesh Internet 
Governance Forum (BIGF) since 2006 in conjunction with the UN IGF.

SDGs implementation  
 
• Inadequate partnership among the government and other stakeh olders  
• Inadequate stakeholders’ engagement for SDGs implementation  
• Non-state actor’s initiative for SDGs implementation is not reflected in the 
Government progress report  
• Gaps in aligning the SDGs with the mainstreaming development plan.  
• Along with health,  education, and other sectors, Covid -19 has adversely affected 
informal  
• sector employment and overseas employment. Rapid recovery from the Covid -19 
pandemic  
• to restore human health, confidence, employment, income, and economic activities 
is 
required.  
• Tradi tional sources of funding are inadequate, and the government needs to find 
innovative  ways for SDG financing. Financing for SDG1 is also a challenge. 
Additionally, resource  
 
• Mobilization particularly from external sources is also a big challenge.  
 
Which me asures are necessary?  
• Develop effective mechanism for SDGs related data governance  
 
• Enhance coordination and collaboration among the government agencies and non -
state actor’s  
 
• Ensure funding arrangement for SDGs implementation by 2030  
• Enhance monitoring of SDGs implementation  
• Inclusive Framework for SDG Localization  
• Lack of Data on Indicators and insufficient domestic spending on SDGs  
• Capacity Building of the institutions Bangladesh’s readiness and what can be done 
further finance, technology, and capacity building

including  through enhanced development cooperation, to provide adequate and 
predictable means  to implement programs and policies to end poverty in all it s 
dimensions.  
 
• Significant changes and shifts have taken place in the foreign assistance landscape 
in recent years. Along with traditional development partners, some southern 
countries have  emerged as an important source of economic and technical 
cooperati on for the Global  South including Bangladesh. In the wake of severe 
challenges caused by climate change,  climate financing is emerging as an 
additional complementary window of development  financing which is expected to 
have larger implications on overall f oreign assistance and  interventions to ensure 
sustainable development. On the other hand, there is an agreement  both at national 
and global discussions for enhanced transparency and accountability of  
foreign assistance through making all types of aid data public.  
 
How can GDC contribute to addressing SDGs implementation?  
• Global Digital Compact should work as catalysts for harmonizing to improve 
digital cooperation, bridge digital divides and accelerate the positive contribution 
of digital technologies in developing countries.  
 
• GDC should emphasize and engage with SDG 16 implementation in line with 
enabling of culture digital transformation and governance.  
 
• At the global level, building on past experiences the international community has 
been striving to harness the benefits of development assistance and accordingly 
several high level  meetings on development cooperation set out clear commitments 
to be adhered to  both by providers of development assistance and partner countries.  
 
What can be our future actions on SDGs?  
• Mainstreaming SDGs into national planning processes in view of national priorities  
 
• Management, coordination and leadership for SDGs implementation  
 
• Financing and other means of implementation including systemic issues  
 
• Avail ability and Adequacy of Data to Monitor the SDGs  
 
• Partnership and stakeholder participation including institutional arrangements.  
 
• Digital Information Centers in grassroots levels contributed to access to 
information in many areas of SDGs  
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Digital techno logy significantly contributed to achieving SDGs.  
 
• Digitalization in workplace safety monitoring and inspection mechanism already 
contributing positively to improving Occupational Safety and Health at the 
workplace of Bangladesh.   
 
• An effective coordination mechanism is important to ensure results -oriented 
partnership  management within the government and between the government and 
development  partners. For this, there is a need to maintain and nurture constructive 
and mutually  beneficial coordina tion mechanisms. The fundamental of the 
partnership between the  government and development partners is that it should be 
rooted deep in the spirit of  equal partnership. Further, the government aims to 
ensure coherence, transparency, and  predictability for effective climate change 
finance.  
 
We hope this contribution will nurture the Global Digital Compact, with the objective to 
achieve an  open, free, and secure digital future for all. The Tech Envoy should also uphold 
and improve the current multi -stakeholder model of Internet governance, which is open, 
inclusive and decentralized.  
 
The independent position of the Tech Envoy, under the direct responsibility of the UN 
Secretary -General, can also ensure that the promotion and protection of inter national 
human rights standards are mainstreamed through all the strands of action of the 
Roadmap’s and Common Agenda’s implementation, making clear that the priorities 
remain profoundly interconnected.
