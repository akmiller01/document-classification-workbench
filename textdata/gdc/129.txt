IGF Coalition on Platform Responsibility  
contribution  to the Global Digital Compact  
 
The Dynamic Coalition on Platform Responsibility  has a 
particular focus on the role that platforms play in shaping the 
online environment. We believe that platforms have a 
responsibility to act in the best interests of their users, to 
ensure that their products and services are safe, secure, 
trustworthy , and that they respect and promote human rights.  
Our recent work has been focusing on exploring a variety of 
subjects, and as such w e propose the following contributions to 
the Global Digital Compact:  
 
 1. Meaningful Transparency and Accountability : Platforms 
must be transparent in their policies, practices, and decision -
making processes. They should provide clear and easily accessible 
information about their data collection and use, content 
moderation practices, and algorithmic decision -making. Platforms  
should also be accountable for the impact of their decisions on 
users, society, and the environment. For more on this topic, 
please consult our 2022 outcome on Meaningful and Interoperable 
Transparency, available at: 
https://www.intgovforum.org/en/filedepot_download/57/23886 .  
 2. User Empowerment and Interoperability : Platforms should 
empower users by providing them with tools and information to 
control their online experience. This includes the ability to 
control their data, to understand how their data is used, and to 
make informed decisions about the content they consume and share. 
A best practice in this aspect is to make software and hardware 
interoperable by default. For more on this topic, please see the 
DCPR 2021 session report: 
https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf -2021-dcpr-platform -
interoperability -understanding -a-complex-issue.  
 3. Diversity and Inclusion : To decrease wrongful and harmful 
practices in content moderation there is a need to promote 
diversity and the inclusion of minorities' standpoints. Platforms 
should, in addition, ensure risk assessment in their products and 
services to address issues of bias and discrimination in content 
moderation and algorithmic decision -making. For more on this 
topic, please see our 2017 ou tcome:

platforms -are-regulated -and-how-they-regulate -us.  
 4. Shared lexicon for platform policy making : with the aim 
to provide a comprehensive and user -friendly glossary of platform 
governance terms, in January 2022 the DCPR launched a wiki as an 
offshoot of its 2021 outcome (the boo k "Glossary of Platform Law 
and Policy Terms" ed. by Luca Belli, Nicolo Zingales and Yasmin 
Curzi, available at: 
https://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/dspace/handle/10438/31365 .). 
This wiki serves as a valuable knowledge repository for 
policymakers, professionals, students, and enthusiasts alike, 
offering clear and concise definitions, explanations, and examples 
for commonly used terms and jargon within th e ever-evolving 
platform governance landscape. The Platform Glossary wiki is 
available at: https://platformglossary.info .  
 
We believe that these contributions will help to create a more 
responsible and sustainable digital world, where platforms act in 
the best interests of their users and society as a whole. Our work 
throughout the past d ecade has shown the possible paths for the 
development of a responsible and multistakeholder approach to 
platform policy:
