Dr. Amandeep Singh Gill
Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology United Nations
New York, New York
United States of America
Dear Dr. Amandeep Singh Gill,
VMind is a privately funded, for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research
and compute corporation based in San Francisco, California and Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.
As a stakeholder in regulation of artificial intelligence, VMind followed a
Habermasian process, rooted in the philosophy of Jürgen Habermas, that
emphasizes communicative action and the importance of inclusive, democratic deliberation, to prepare this input for the Global Digital Compact.
VMind believes all governments, companies, civil society organizations and
other stakeholders of regulation of artificial intelligence should pledge the
following principium:
To responsibly develop artificial intelligence for the use and sake of
humanity, and never for its harm.
This principium follows from a pluralistic synthesis by leading Oxford ethicist Luciano Floridi (2019) of major AI ethics declarations from across the
world down to a set of five common agreed-upon principles: (1) explicability, (2) beneficence, (3) autonomy (4) justice, and (5) non-maleficence.
If you have any questions or comments about this input, please contact
Jabran Ilyas, VMind Head of AI Ethics, at jabran.ilyas@vmindai.com.
Respectfully,
VMind Technologies, Inc.

Annex: Process
VMind followed a Habermasian process, rooted in the philosophy of Jürgen
Habermas, that emphasizes communicative action and the importance of inclusive, democratic deliberation. To prepare this input, VMind took the following
steps:
1. Identifying diverse stakeholders: VMind first identified a diverse range of
stakeholders from the within the company, ensuring that multiple perspectives
were considered in the process.
2. Promoting open and inclusive communication: To facilitate democratic deliberation, VMind organized a series of online fora where stakeholders could
engage in open and inclusive dialogue. The company ensured that these platforms were accessible to all within the company, providing accommodations
where relevant.
3. Establishing a transparent and accountable process: VMind made sure that
the deliberative process was transparent and accountable by publishing agendas,
minutes, and decisions of the meetings to everyone in the company. This allowed
stakeholders and everyone else in the company to follow the process and hold
participants accountable for their actions, if any.
4. Encouraging rational discourse: VMind emphasized the importance of rational discourse, which is a key component of Habermasian communication. This
meant that participants were encouraged to present evidence-based arguments,
critique others’ positions constructively, and strive for consensus in decisionmaking.
5. Ensuring equal participation: VMind took measures to ensure that all stakeholders had an equal opportunity to participate in the deliberative process. This
involved providing resources, such as training and support, to help every participant engage effectively in the discussions regardless of their role or seniority
in the company.
6. Iterative consultation and feedback: VMind carried out multiple rounds of
consultation and feedback to refine the input document. This iterative process
allowed stakeholders to address any concerns, suggestions, or objections and
helped reach a broad consensus.

7. Integrating consensus outcomes: Once the deliberations concluded, VMind
integrated the outcomes into the final input document for the Global Digital
Compact. The company made sure to highlight areas of consensus, as well as
acknowledge differing opinions and the reasoning behind them.
8. Publicizing the final input document: To maintain transparency and accountability, VMind published the final input document within the company’s
internal network, making it accessible to all interested parties. This allowed
for ongoing feedback and monitoring of VMind’s input for the Global Digital
Compact.
