EVIDENCE  
We see enormous strength in 
providing an interdisciplinary 
response to the call for evidence to 
the Global Digital Compact.  
This call comes at a critical time, as 
governments around the world bring 
forward fragmented legislative 
agendas toward digital policy.   
The evidence covers the digital issues 
mentioned in the United 
Nations Common Agenda identifying 
issues that should be addressed in 
the Global Digital Compact.  
The digital issues covered are: 
1.Connect all people to the internet,
including all schools
2.Avoid internet fragmentation
3.Protect data
4.Apply human rights online
5.Introduce accountability criteria for
discrimination and misleading content
6.Promote regulation of artificial
intelligence
7.Digital commons as a global public
goodWe opened dialogue on this topic 
through group and individual 
consultations with colleagues across 
the University of Cambridge, 
exploring the seven issues by 
development ‘core principles’ and 
‘key commitments’ to address each, 
for example: 
1) Core principles that all
governments, companies, civil
society organisations, and other
stakeholders should adhere to;
2) Key commitments to bring about
these specific principles. These can
take the form of what you think
“should” be done
Our dialogues identified an eighth 
digital issue: Environmental 
Consequences, that needed 
addressing through the Global Digital 
Compact.  
For reference, the full guidance note 
to submitting evidence for the Global 
Digital Compact is available here.

You can consult with others and share 
the collective views, or you can submit 
your individual views on the Global 
Digital Compact website.  
The Global Digital Compact is 
expected to “outline shared principles 
for an open, free and secure digital 
future for all”. It is expected to be 
agreed at the Summit of the Future in 
2024. 
At the Minderoo Centre for 
Technology and Democracy, we will 
endeavour to put into practice the 
principles discussed here, as we 
develop evidenced-based research 
on the relationship between digital 
technology, society and the planet.  STEPS
