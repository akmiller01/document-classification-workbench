The relevance of the IGF’s dynamic coalitions to the GDC initiative The IGF’s dynamic coalitions are widely recognized as contributing additional important value to the IGF eco-system and, more broadly, to the practical application of a multistakeholder approach to digital policy challenges. These multistakeholder coalitions are voluntary groups of experts from all regions who collaborate on specific technology policy areas on a continuous year-round basis. Their broad aims are to identify new transformative opportunities in the global digital economy, and to address the challenges, risks and threats in their respective Internet and digital technology fields. Within the broad range of multistakeholder engagement in the IGF eco-system, the dynamic coalitions have demonstrated that they provide crucial focus and in-depth analysis which can help to shape policy decisions on specific issues in the wider global community, for example in addressing risks to citizens’ online welfare and rights, and in combatting private and public sector cyber-based threats. A number of dynamic coalitions have developed and published consensus-based principles, guidelines and policy recommendations based on the outcomes of their research. Dynamic coalitions in this way perform the kind of “policy incubator” function envisaged for the strengthened “IGF Plus” in the report of the UN Secretary General’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation (The Age of Digital Interdependence, 2019).  Meaningful multistakeholder participation is difficult to achieve and sustain. In its efforts to build consensus on key principles and putting these into practice, the GDC process can benefit from the experience and insights gained by IGF’s Dynamic Coalitions over the last 17 years. Supported by the Dynamic Coalitions Coordination Group (DCCG), dynamic coalitions offer their continuing support for the GDC and look forward to providing further inputs at all stages of the development process, 
including at the Summit of the Future and in the subsequent implementation phase of the Compact.  A list of the 25 current IGF dynamic coalitions, with links to the descriptions of their aims and programmes of activity, is accessible on the IGF website at:  https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/explore-dynamic-coalitions The role of the Dynamic Coalitions Coordination Group (DCCG) is described at: https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/dc-coordination-activities  II. First phase of DCCG consultations on the role of dynamic coalitions in the GDC (September-November 2022) A consultation conducted by the Dynamic Coalitions Coordination Group (DCCG) during preparations for the IGF in Addis Ababa in 2022 confirmed that many of the dynamic coalitions expected to participate in the multistakeholder consultations for the development of the GDC’s principles and stakeholder commitments to action.  This opportunity for dynamic coalitions to support the GDC was discussed during the DCCG’s main session at the IGF on 22 November 2022. Representatives of individual dynamic coalitions described how their specific areas of technology and policy focus were relevant to the GDC.  There was broad agreement in the session that there are substantive opportunities for dynamic coalitions to contribute to the GDC on issues such as access and connectivity for disadvantaged communities, capacity-building, human rights online, child protection and children’s rights, gender, online security and safety, disinformation, digital technologies in the heath sector, the impact of automation on job opportunities, and environmental sustainability. It was also reported by the Dynamic Coalition on Schools of Internet Governance (DC-SIG) that consultations on the GDC were being carried out by a number of schools of Internet governance worldwide.   III. Second phase of DCCG consultations on the role of dynamic coalitions in the GDC (January-April 2023) A further round of consultations by the DCCG in 2023 reaffirmed the commitment of dynamic coalitions to support the Compact by reaching out to the wider community. The responses reaffirmed that because they provide the space for multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaboration, dynamic coalitions are able to facilitate discussions among different stakeholder groups who come together to engage their mutual interest in a specific technology area or issue of Internet policy and governance. Dynamic coalitions are also able to reach out more easily to individuals, groups and organisations at the regional and local levels which would otherwise likely be disengaged from Internet governance processes.  This second phase of consultations also confirmed that a number of dynamic coalitions intend to participate as experts in leading discussions on specific GDC thematic areas, and to contribute actively to the dissemination and wider 
implementation of the GDC following its launch in 2024. It was also suggested that dynamic coalitions with a direct interest in a GDC thematic areas could include GDC goals in their action plans and offer to release relevant research and policy documents. In summary, the general consensus amongst the IGF’s dynamic coalitions is that they have the potential to contribute to the GDC initiative in the following five ways:  i. Responding to the current consultation phase led by the Tech Envoy and in this way inform the discussions at the UN in New York through channelling inputs from Internet stakeholder communities.  ii. Contributing actively to landing and implementing the GDC’s principles, commitments and guidance following the conclusion of the Member States’ negotiations at the Summit of the Future in September 2024. iii. Supporting the GDC by reaching out through the coalitions’ networks to the wider community of stakeholders and users of digital technologies in all regions, in order to promote awareness of the GDC, of the importance of its implementation and of adoption of its principles and commitments. iv. Facilitating discussion of GDC aims and commitments amongst interested stakeholder communities that are represented in the dynamic coalitions, and developing inputs from coalition members that will inform the wider group of global stakeholders on how best to progress the GDC on specific issues. For example, specific requests could be submitted during the implementation phase to individual dynamic coalitions for key data relating to best practices.   v. Contributing to the GDC’s alignment with the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for example on health, employment and digital inclusion, with particular reference to isolated, underserved, marginalised and disadvantaged communities, and persons with disabilities.   IV. Individual dynamic coalition responses to the Tech Envoy’s questionnaire The following IGF dynamic coalitions have notified the DCCG of their intention to submit responses to the Tech Envoy’s questionnaire on specific thematic areas: 1.

Proposals by dynamic coalitions for additional GDC thematic areas The following IGF dynamic coalitions have proposed additional thematic areas for inclusion in the GDC in response to the Tech Envoy’s questionnaire: DC on Accessibility and Disability: Accessibility (following and adhering to the Accessibility Standards promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C]) Security, and Capacity Building  DC on Children’s Rights in the Digital Environment: Ensuring proactive prevention of harms and prompt response and remedy by providers of online services DC on Digital Health: Capacity Building to Achieve Digital Transformation DC on Environment: Sustainable use of Technology DC on Internet and Jobs: Livelihood for all through digitalization DC on Internet of Things: Ecological impact of IoT Internet Rights and Principles Coalition:  Ensure an environmentally sustainable digital transformation Internet Standards, Security and Safety Coalition: Cybersecurity  VI. Recommendations for the GDC by the IGF's Youth Coalition (YCIG) The Youth Coalition on Internet Governance (YCIG) ensures that the voices of young people are heard in the IGF’s processes. The YCIG reported during the Dynamic 
Coalitions main session at the IGF in Addis Ababa that it was actively engaged in promoting awareness of the GDC in the expectation of contributing actively to its development.  In a summary of his takeaways from the main session, the Tech Envoy welcomed the YCIG’s commitment to engage across all issues within the scope of the GDC and he set the inspirational target of getting a million youth voices into the GDC before the Summit of the Future.  Following subsequent consultations, the YCIG makes the following recommendations for the Global Digital Compact:  1. Digital Connectivity: the GDC should address the digital divide and ensure universal access to digital connectivity for all young people; and conduct research and outreach initiatives to understand the connectivity challenges facing young people; and provide concrete recommendations for addressing the digital divide, in line with the "CONNECT" principle. 2. Human Rights Online: the GDC should include measures to protect human rights online, such as privacy, freedom of expression, and digital security; and engage in advocacy and awareness-raising efforts. 3. Data Protection: the GDC should ensure individuals have control over their personal data and to have options regarding its use; and conduct research and outreach initiatives to understand young people's perspectives on data protection. 4. Privacy in Chat Messaging Platforms: the GDC should promote the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies and the protection of personal data in chat messaging platforms. 5. Trustworthy Internet: the GDC should address issues such as online harassment, cyberbullying, and misleading content to promote a trustworthy Internet. 6. Enhance Cybersecurity Skills: the GDC should promote initiatives that support the development of cybersecurity skills for young people, in line with the "PROTECT" principle. 7. Digital Literacy: the GDC should support digital literacy education for young people and promote digital skills development, to equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to participate effectively in the digital age. 8. Internet Fragmentation: the GDC should include measures to avoid Internet fragmentation and ensure an open and accessible Internet for all young people. 9. Promote Equitable and Safe AI Development: the GDC should advocate policies and programs that support equitable and safe development of AI technologies that benefit all members of society in line with the "RESPECT" principle. 10. Strengthening Critical Infrastructure: The GDC should make recommendations to ensure that critical infrastructure is protected from potential cyber threats and has the necessary safeguards to operate effectively in the event of an attack, including wider deployment of secure 
networks with the use of RPKI, IPSec, DNS-sec, post-quantum encryption and other technologies. 11. Internet of Things (IoT) Security: the GDC should promote the adoption of best practices by industry and governments to ensure the security of IoT devices and the protection of personal data. 12. Quantum Communications: the GDC should promote investment in the development of quantum communication technologies and their integration into the global digital infrastructure; and raise awareness of the potential threats posed by quantum computing and the need for mitigation strategies. 13. Interplanetary Internet: the GDC should promote investment in the development of interplanetary communication networks. The YCIG recommends the following to increase youth inclusion in Internet governance:  1. Participation in Internet governance processes: the GDC should increase youth participation in Internet governance decision-making and ensure that young people's voices and perspectives are heard. 2. Funding for Youth Internet Governance Forums: the GDC should make recommendations to secure funding for these initiatives to ensure the continued engagement of young people in internet governance. Regarding the GDC process, the YCIG proposes the following:  1. Representation of Youth in the GDC: a youth representative role should be established in the GDC’s decision-making process to ensure that the perspectives and needs of young people are taken into account. 2. Cross-sector Collaboration: to ensure a comprehensive and integrated approach, the GDC should enhance cross-sector collaboration among all stakeholders, including governments, the UN system, the private sector, civil society, grass-roots organizations, academia, and individuals. 3. Continuous GDC Engagement: the GDC should provide ongoing engagement and support for its implementation, including monitoring progress, advocating for policies and initiatives, and engaging young people in discussions.      ==============================================================  DCCG’s Coordinator on the Global Digital Compact: Mark Carvell - IS3C Senior Policy Adviser                                                                       E: markhbcarvell@gmail.com
