The
Global
Initiative
for
Digital
Empowerment
('GIDE')
is
committed
to
ensuring
citizens
become
active
participants
in
the
digital
economy ,
irrespective
of
their
country's
level
of
development.
While
we
recognise
that
dif ferent
countries
deal
with
dif ferent
digital
obstacles,
we
argue
that
many
can
be
better
solved
by
re-balancing
the
current
power
structures
of
online
interactions.
This
can
be
achieved
through
strong
representation
rights
and
institutions,
by
applying
to
digital
interactions
long-standing
fiduciary
rules
of
the
of fline
world,
and
by
ensuring
that
artificial
intelligence
actors
embed
in
their
algorithms
human-first
and
human-needs
features
to
their
tools.
The
GIDE
considers
that
a
humane
digital
ecosystem,
and
a
human-centred
digital
regime,
must
position
people
and
their
dignity
at
the
centre
of
governance
models;
but
also
recognise
that
humans
are
social
creatures
who
derive
life
meaning
in
conducting
personal
relationships
and
belonging
to
social
groups,
both
of
their
own
choosing
and
with
high
expectations
of
freedom.
W e
are
committed
to
collaborating
with
the
United
Nations
to
achieve
human
empowerment
and
celebrate
the
inclusion
of
the
Global
Digital
Compact
(GDC)
as
part
of
Our
Common
Agenda.
Human
empowerment
can
also
become
a
driver
for
innovation
and
economic
growth.
While
we
celebrate
that
most
legislations
around
the
globe
embed
long-standing
principles
of
digital
governance
(OECD,
1980)
as
well
as
international
instruments
on
human
rights
and
recent
legislative
development
in
leading
countries
provide
a
first
shift
toward
human
empowerment,
we
consider
that
further
work
needs
to
be
done
to
achieve
the
key
proposals
of
the
United
Nations
'Our
Common
Agenda'
report.
Indeed,
the
GDC
should
consider
first-generation
legislation
such
as
the
General
Data
Protection
Directive
('GDPR')
and
the
California
Consumer
Privacy
Act
(USA)
the
first
step
into
citizen
empowerment;
and
recent
legislative
development,
or
second-generation
legislation,
in
Europe
(EU
EIDAS,
Data
Act
,
Data
Governance
Act,
etc)
and
elsewhere
(eg.
Blueprint
for
an
AI
Bill
of
Rights
(USA)
a
second
building
block
for
a
humane-centred
digital
governance
regime.
Looking
into
the
future,
the
GDC
should
aim
to
deliver
a
third
building
block,
one
that
ensures
that
every
group,
community ,
and
country
can
create
frameworks
and
institutions
that
allow
citizens
to
gain
ef fective
control
over
who
accesses
data
about
them
and
under
what
terms.
For
that
reason,
we
propose
the
GDC
adopts
and
promotes
the
following
as
the
guiding
principles
for
the
next
generation
of
digital
governance
regimes:
1)
Humane-centred
approach
to
digital
governance:
the
GIDE
is
committed
to
working
with
the
GDC
to
change
the
digital
economy
data-centric
for
a
citizens-first
approach,
making
people
and
their
safety
the
ultimate
focus
of
protection,
and
not
just
data
about
them.
Such
a
model
for
a
digital
governance
regime
should
be
preferred
as
it
maximises
people's
dignity
as
human
beings.
It
also
provides
broader
protection
to
a
number
of
human
digital
and
non-digital
rights,
not
only
the
right
to
online
privacy
or
freedom
of
speech.
Much
of
the
GIDEâ€™ s
approach
to
a
person-focused
approach
to
digital
governance
can
be
found
in
our
2022
report
Empowering
Digital
Citizens
.
There
are
other
reasons
to
recommend
that
the
GDC
adopts
a
human-centric
approach
to
digital
governance.
Indeed,
placing
people
at
the
centre
of
digital
transformation
injects
transparency
and
accountability
into
the
ecosystem;
and
higher
levels
of
trust
are
likely
to
raise
the
amount
of
data
willingly
shared
by
citizens,
which
is
vital
to
foster
horizontal
innovation,
more
competition
and
fair
digital
markets.
The
GDC
should
be
an
active
advocate
of
human-centred
digital
regimes,
and
position
humans
and
their
needs
at
the
centre
of
their
digital
policies.
The
relevance
of
people
as
key
members
of
the
digital
society
should
also
be
extended
to
the
decision-making
processes
and
architectural
schemes,
echoing
the
openness,
inclusiveness
and
decentralisation
features
of
the
multistakeholder
regime
for
Internet
governance.
2)
Control
over
data:
W e
are
committed
to
working
with
the
GDC
to
find
proper
mechanisms
to
raise
the
level
of
protection
to
citizens
in
the
digital
arena,
which
includes
novel
threats
to
human
experience
and
life.
These
are
best
achieved
when
individuals
have
adequate
control
over
how
data
about
them
is
collected,
stored,
shared
and
processed.
The
GIDE
recommends
the
GDC
avoids
discussions
around
personal
ownership
of
data.
W e
observe
that
the
full
legal
debate
about
ownership
is
a
complex
one.
Rather ,
we
argue
for
a
dif ferent
path.
Policymakers
should
focus
on
the
right
of
individuals
to
control
who
has
access
to
their
personal
data
and
on
what
terms
such
data
is
used.
The
GDC
should
also
not
rely
on
policies
that
mostly
confer
protection
to
humans
after
they
have
entered
digital
interactions
or
focused
mostly
(solely)
on
data
about
them.
Such
a
rationale
is
flawed
not
only
because
these
policies
find
legal
origin
in
adhesion
agreements
where
clauses
are
binary ,
non-negotiable
and
non-amendable
by
consumers;
but
also
because
they
follow
the
fictitious
assumptions
that
individuals
interact
with
(or
have
knowledge
of)
every
entity
that
holds
information
about
them;
and
that
the
separation
between
online
and
offline
activities
truly
exists.
In
contrast,
a
fair
digital
ecosystem
must
protect
humans
and
their
digital
and
non-digital
rights
well
before
they
are
at
the
gates
of
digital
interaction,
knowingly
or
not.
In
particular ,
the
GIDE
urges
the
GDC
to
consider
that
the
expansion
of
datafication
of
human
experience
is
no
longer
confined
to
direct
and
external
activities
undertaken
by
data
subjects.
Indeed,
technologies
around
emotion
detection,
af fect
recognition,
neurotechnologies
as
well
as
the
internet
of
things
and
the
internet
of
bodies,
show
how
an
ever-growing
number
of
technologies
have
begun
to
more
actively
reach
information
about
consumers
that
were
not
envisioned
by
the
current
digital
regime.
Moreover ,
an
equally
large
number
of
companies
are
more
aggressively
obtaining
data
and
inferences
of
personal
data
through
indirect
methods.
These
go
well
beyond
contractual
relations
with
third
parties
that
do
not
have
any
commercial
relationship
or
obligations
with
people,
such
as
data
brokers;
and
include
new
technologies
such
as
external
reality
technologies
and
smart
cities
that
collect
and
process
passive
data,
automatically
and
autonomously ,
that
can
hardly
be
considered
personal
when
first
collected,
as
it
can
be
anonymised
or
encrypted,
but
nevertheless
become
personal
in
much
later
stages
when
used
to
feed
machine
learning
algorithms.
In
other
words,
technologies
that
do
not
necessarily
collect
personal
data
but
that
can
obtain
the
same
insight
and
the
same
inferences
about
people.
Empowering
citizens
to
control
how
their
data
is
processed
and
under
what
terms
will
also
empower
small
companies
and
start-ups
companies
to
innovate
by
countering
the
anti-competitive
ef fects
of
vast
information
lakes
held
by
the
market's
leaders.
Legislation
in
Europe
(
Data
Act,
Digital
Governance
Act
)
has
already
taken
the
first
step
to
solve
this
issue.
For
example,
our
proposals
are
in
line
with
the
creation
of
data
representatives
and
data
altruism
(which
we
call
Data
Commons).
However ,
without
proper
economic
and
social
incentives,
these
legislations
may
not
only
be
gamed
by
the
biggest
players,
but
they
will
have
little
real
applicability .
For
that
reason,
we
recommend
the
GDC
develop
policies
that
advocate
for
open
data
repositories
allowing
a
wider
variety
of
companies
to
get
decentralised,
high-quality
and
ongoing
sources
of
information.
The
GDC
should
spearhead
this
transition
as
it
fosters
better ,
faster
and
equitable
innovation,
more
jobs
and
ultimately
economic
growth.
A
human-centred
digital
governance
regime
carries
de
facto
governance
changes,
most
importantly ,
leaving
the
ability
of
technologies
to
protect
individual
rights
as
a
secondary
feature.
As
outlined
below ,
the
primary
engine
to
achieve
human
empowerment
is
to
allow
citizens
to
collectively
negotiate
the
terms
and
conditions
of
data
processing
made
by
skilled
representatives.
3)
Best
interest
of
the
data
subject:
The
digital
economy
will
likely
achieve
its
full
potential
by
drawing
from
long-standing
principles
of
asymmetric
relations
of
the
of fline
world.
As
in
any
other
market,
the
needs
and
interests
of
consumers
must
be
properly
weighed
and
considered.
In
consequence,
the
GDC
should
promote
policies
that
ensure
governments
and
companies
conduct
their
business
operations
with
the
best
interest
of
consumers
as
a
cornerstone.
Such
an
approach
brings
higher
protection
and
respect
to
digital
and
non-digital
human
rights,
which
is
also
in
line
with
the
GDC's
common
agenda
report
of
the
Secretary-General,
by
renewing
social
contracts
through
anchored
human
rights.
Moreover ,
this
policy
goal
also
benefits
consumers
as
much
as
private
entities.
Indeed,
as
outlined
above,
acting
in
the
consumer's
best
interest
will
help
a
vast
number
of
organisations
enjoy
the
many
benefits
attached
to
high
levels
of
trust
between
market
participants.
Medical
and
scientific
research
for
the
public
good,
for
example,
are
likely
to
obtain
better
results
when
they
receive
higher
quantity
and
quality
of
data
directly
from
citizens.
Acting
in
the
best
interest
of
digital
consumers
also
supposes
a
higher
level
of
online
safety
and
well-being.
While
we
celebrate
legislation
around
the
Christchurch
call,
we
argue
that
a
human-first
regime
for
digital
governance,
citizens'
ef fective
control
over
data
and
a
general
fiduciary
rule
of
care,
loyalty
and
good
faith
to
digital
interactions
would
allow
such
legislation
to
more
ef ficiently
serve
their
purpose
and
urge
the
DGC
to
be
at
the
forefront
of
these
changes.
Finally ,
a
human-centred
model
for
digital
governance
raises
the
level
of
participation
of
all
citizens
in
the
digital
economy ,
which
also
includes
non-users
or
vulnerable
groups.
Considering
that
almost
half
of
the
world's
population
has
no
internet
access,
including
1.3
billion
children
aged
3
to
17
years
old
and
that
many
of
them
are
also
socially
or
economically
vulnerable,
the
GDC
should
promote
approaches
to
digital
governance
that
maximise
citizen
participation.
For
that
reason,
we
recommend
that
the
GDC
leads
button-up
and
multi-stakeholder
processes
of
policymaking
to
ensure
that
no
one
is
left
behind
and
ensures
that
everyone
gets
a
seat
at
the
table.
For
the
reasons
above
is
that
the
GIDE
invites
the
GDC
to
actively
promote
ef forts
to
include
the
best
interest
of
people
as
the
core
legal
concept
in
the
next
generation
of
digital
governance
regulations
around
the
globe.
Current
legislation,
particularly
in
Europe,
is
already
rising
to
such
a
challenge.
The
European
Declaration
for
Digital
Rights
and
Principles,
the
Artificial
Intelligence
Act
and
the
Digital
W allet
Recommendations
has
already
put
citizens
at
the
centre
of
digital
transformation.
Moreover ,
the
best
interest
of
data
subjects
will
likely
be
one
of
the
guiding
principles
of
the
upcoming
review
of
the
GDPR.
4)
Right
of
Representation
:
One
of
the
biggest
challenges
for
policymakers
is
to
provide
measures
to
better
balance
the
extreme
power ,
skills
and
knowledge
asymmetries
between
consumers
and
digital
technologies
providers.
This
makes
it
impossible
for
citizens
to
meaningfully
control
information
about
them.
This
failure
is
further
exacerbated
by
the
high
levels
of
market
dominance
of
the
largest
digital
firms.
For
that
reason,
the
GDC
should
promote
the
development
of
strong
rights
of
association
and
representation,
and
allow
citizens
to
participate
in
the
digital
economy
collectively ,
through
skilled
digital
representatives.
The
idea
behind
this
principle
is
based
on
both
economic
and
social
reasons.
Indeed,
although
we
consider
the
GDC
should
avoid
debates
around
the
economic
value
of
data,
the
reality
is
most
data
is
currently
processed
as
if
it
was
the
means
of
production
for
goods
and
services.
Put
on
economic
terms,
the
GIDE
is
committed
to
working
with
the
GDC
to
develop
policies
that
allow
citizens
to
collectively
negotiate
access
to
the
resource
rather
than
its
location.
Finally ,
the
GDC
should
lead
ef forts
to
find
the
necessary
architecture
and
legal
environment
for
the
proper
landing
of
collective
digital
representation,
including
key
challenges
such
as
tailoring
and
improving
existing
mechanisms
to
the
digital
ecosystem,
independence,
reachability
and
legal
limits,
accountability
and
oversight.
5)
Artificial
Intelligence
Ethics:
The
humans-first
digital
governance
regime
proposed
by
the
GIDE
requires
ensuring
that
Artificial
Intelligence
('AI')
actors
adopt
and
promote
such
framework,
not
only
in
the
application
of
AI
systems
to
personal
data,
but
also
in
the
collection
and
use
of
personal
data
in
machine
learning
datasets
which
underpins
its
development.
This
becomes
particularly
important
given
the
accelerated
speed
of
AI
technology
and
the
fact
that
many
of
these
tools
can
autonomously
be
fed
with
publicly
available
information.
As
mentioned
above,
the
concept
of
bottom-up
and
multi-stakeholder
development
is
crucial
to
achieving
a
broad
AI
ethical
framework,
as
their
procedures
are
considered
to
be
the
gold
standard
for
social
inclusion
of
vulnerable
groups.
This
gains
exponential
importance
when
considering
that
many
algorithms
currently
have
some
sort
of
bias
against
minorities
and
other
vulnerable
groups.
Examples
in
the
Internet
regime
of
governance
also
speak
of
other
valuable
goals
to
consider ,
such
as
a
higher
level
of
trust
and
reliability
in
the
system.
Importantly ,
the
GDC
should
advocate
for
the
inclusion
of
these
principles
into
AI
systems
as
it
helps
to
solve
one
of
the
most
troublesome
issues
around
data
collection.
Indeed,
collective
agreements
reached
through
rights
of
representation
can
enjoy
automatic
oversight
when
AI
actors
adopt
a
human-centred
approach
to
algorithms.
For
example,
non-personal
data,
while
being
increasingly
easily
converted
into
personal
data
but
bound
to
a
much
lower
level
of
legal
protection,
can
more
easily
be
moved
and
shared
between
stakeholders.
However ,
embedding
human-needs-first
features
in
algorithms
would
ensure
a
higher
level
of
protection
for
citizens,
irrespective
of
whether
or
when
these
companies
convert
such
non-personal
data
into
personal
data.
The
GIDE
also
recognises
that
achieving
AI's
full
potential
for
societal
good
in
the
long
term
requires
that
civilians
operate
with
a
higher
level
of
digital
literacy .
For
that
reason,
we
believe
that
the
GDC
must
work
with
other
relevant
stakeholders
to
develop
manuals
and
guidelines
to
be
included
in
school
curriculums
to
ensure
that
new
generations
have
the
necessary
skills
to
fully
enjoy
the
digital
society .
Importantly ,
digital
civic
education
will
require
maintaining
our
of ficial
digital
information
accurate
and
up
to
date.
T o
develop
its
proposals
on
AI
ethics,
the
GIDE
recommends
the
GCD
to
lean
on
already
existent
policy
and
legal
documents
(eg.
the
G20
and
OECD
AI
principles
and
the
European
and
United
States
AI
acts
).
However ,
further
work
needs
to
be
done
at
a
policy
level
to
avoid
situations
where
intended
or
unintended
outcomes
put
citizens,
especially
the
most
vulnerable,
at
risk.
The
GIDE
considers
that
the
GDC,
as
a
United
Nations
body ,
should
spearhead
the
development
of
the
next
set
of
AI
principles.
6)
Final
remarks:
The
GIDE
is
committed
to
working
with
GDC
and
developing
policies
that
ensure
that
every
country ,
irrespective
of
their
level
of
economic
development,
can
create
legal
frameworks
and
institutions
that
allow
citizens
to
gain
ef fective
control
over
who
accesses
data
about
them
and
under
what
terms.
This
goal
can
be
achieved
by
adopting
a
human-centred
approach
to
digital
governance,
made
through
ef fective
control
of
data
and
exercised
by
skilled
representatives;
as
well
as
the
adoption
of
these
changes
by
artificial
intelligence
actors.
The
GIDE
also
celebrates
that
all
the
above-outlined
principles
already
exist
in
other
governance
regimes
and
recognises
many
institutions
and
advocates
have
raised
them
as
possible
solutions
to
issues
around
data
management.
However ,
when
applied
in
isolation,
none
of
them
would
make
a
permanent
impact
on
current
overreaching
data
practices.
On
the
contrary ,
they
will
most
likely
support
and
reaf firm
them
as
features
of
the
current
digital
governance
regime.
In
consequence,
we
encourage
the
GDC
to
treat
the
above
outlined
as
indissolubly
intertwined
principles.
A
human-centred
model
for
digital
governance
that
enable
people
to
collectively
negotiate
who
accesses
data
about
them
and
under
what
terms,
coupled
with
fiduciary
obligations
for
data
holders,
and
the
adoption
of
these
principles
by
AI
actors
will
likely
help
to
regulate
not
only
the
tech
industry
but
also
traditional
and
established
markets
that
have
embraced
technification
.
For
example,
when
heavily
unregulated
markets
such
as
smart
health
tracking
devices
(e.g.
smartwatches
and
fitness
apps)
and
online
decentralised
lending
Apps,
are
bound
by
a
human-needs
first
oversight
most
of
the
imbalances
and
abuses
they
carry
will
heavily
disappear .
Finally ,
the
GIDE
recognises
that
human
empowerment
and
people-centred
data
governance
regimes
can
be
achieved
through
many
paths,
including
modifying
existing
technical
architecture,
conducting
legal
reforms
or
creating
new
legal
concepts.
W e
call
for
the
GDC
to
adopt
such
a
neutral
position
in
developing
the
next
stage
of
digital
governance.
