International Telec ommunication Union (ITU), the shar e of individuals usin g internet went from less than 1%

However, the digital landscape has dramatically changed in Myanmar after Februar y 2021, when the Myanmar

Remove all the limitations that block people to access freely all
the contents, social media platforms,etc.

that:
 
These ﬁndings inform decision-mak ers and can enable them to develop conduciv e actions and programm es 
in Myanmar by targetin g audien ces with areas that interest them the most. It could help identif y the what or

Myanmar Foreigner Finally , for th e oc cupation, only on e priority was chosen b y all th e diff erent t ypes of oc cupation:
 digital comm ons as a public good (see c hart 6).   
/eight.numr The UNGDC explains in this 1-pager that “to unlocking a more equitable world, a global effort is needed to encourage 
and invest in the creation of digital public goods: open source software, open data, open artiﬁcial intelligence models, 
open standards and open content. (…) Digital public goods should adhere to privacy and other applicable laws, 
standards and best practices, do no harm. These should also and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals.”   
/nine.numr We notice that the UNGDC has a workstream on digital capacity buildin g and a dedicat ed onlin e platf orm.  Ho wever, 
the datab ase does not allow people to search for speciﬁc contents in Myanmar language. Likewise, it could suppor t the 
translation of regional tools in Myanmar language, such as the Digital Secur ity Communit y Dir ectory or th e Totem 
projec t. 0404
Age inﬂuences prioritisation as well. Proportionally, people over 50 years old did not consider AI 
regulation a priority but were mostly concerned about ensuring Internet access to everyone. People 
below 25 years old focused on ensuring accountability for misleading  content
online, data protection and digital goods (see chart 5).         
 Foreign ers tend to prioritise t wo topics: a ccountabilit y for misle ading contents onlin e an d   a voidin g
