 Joint submission to the Global Digital Compact  
on targeted surveillance  
 
i)  Core principles that all governments, companies, civil society organisations and 
other stakeholders should adhere to; and  
ii)  Key commitments, pledges, or actions that in your view should be taken by 
different stakeholders – governments, private sector, civil society, etc.  
 
i) Core Principles  
Civil society, researchers, activists, and journalists have revealed in multiple instances how 
states’ use of unlawfu l surveillance tools violate s human rights , including among others the 
right to privacy, the rights to freedom of assembly and association, and the right to freedom 
of expression. Fur thermore,  the private surveillance industry has been facilitating those 
abuses and has been allowed to operate in the shadows  unchecked. Hence, states have 
failed in their obligations  to respect as well as to protect people from these human rights 
abuses .  
Where surveillance is operated without adequate legal frameworks, transparency, oversight, 
and effective safeguards, its harms have an  impact far beyond  those who may have actually 
been targeted. In the face of opacity and ina dequate safeguards, human rights defenders 
and journalists are forced to self -censor for fear of being persecuted for their work, even if 
they may not be the target of such surveillance. This can be referred to as a ‘chilling effect’ - 
where people refrain  from exercising their rights out of fear they could be subject to unlawful 
surveillance. The differentiated and intersectional impacts of unlawful surveillance on 
vulnerable or marginalised communities, including women and LGBT groups, is particularly 
egregious.  
As noted in recent reports by UN human rights experts and the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, the capabilities of digital surveillance tools offered on the global market are 
enormous. For example, they can allow “complete and unrestricted acces s to all sensors 
and information on infected devices, effectively turning most smartphones into 24 -hour 
surveillance devices, accessing the camera and microphone, geolocation data, e - mails, 
messages, photos and videos, as well as all applications.” (HCHR report, A/HRC/51/17, para 
7) As such they permit states remote access to systems and therefore potentially to all of the 
data stored on those systems, including the most private information. Hacking  also permits 
governments and other state authorities to conduct novel forms of real -time surveillance as 
well as the manipulation of data.  The reported uses of the tools have been abusive and 
arbitrary, and do not constitut e a permissible interference with the right to privacy.  Further, 
states’ unchecked deployment of these tools does not meet the tests of legality, necessity, 
and proportionality as outlined under international human rights law.

 Too often, states abuse the  concepts of national security or combating serious crime as a 
pretext for the widespread targeting of HRDs. As the UN Special Rapporteur on Counter -
Terrorism has noted : “In recent years, the widespread misuse of surveillance technology 
purportedly in service of counter -terrorism and national security objectives, with concerning 
disregard for fundamental human rights protections, has been exposed in dramatic fashion.” 
The PEGA Committee of the European Parliament, in their draft report , similarly lame nted 
that “Member State authorities have referred to ‘national security’ as justification for the use 
of spyware and for absolute secrecy and lack of accountability.”  
A culture of impunity specific to targeted digital surveillance has developed that must b e 
urgently countered. Our rights and the security of the digital ecosystem as a whole depend 
on it.  
 
b) Key Commitment/ Pledges/ Actions  
We urge all states to urgently take the following steps:   
1.     Immediately put in place a moratorium on the sale, transfer, export, servicing and 
use of spyware technology unti l such time as an adequate system of human rights 
safeguards is in place. This call has been backed by seven former and current UN 
Special Rapporteurs1 and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights2. 
2.     Adopt and enforce a legal framework requiring private surveillance companies and 
their investors to conduct human rights due diligence in their global operations, supply 
chains and in relation to the end use of their products and services.  
3.     Adopt and enforce a legal framework requiring  transparency in acquisition and use of 
surveillance technologies by both public actors and private surveillance companies.

 4.     Ensure that all private surveillance companies domiciled in their countries, including 
sales intermediaries, affiliates, holding companies, or other investors, are required to act 
responsibly and are held liable for adverse human rights impacts.  
5.     As a condition to continued operation of surveillance companies, demand immediate 
establishment of independent, multi -stakeholder oversight bodies for private surveillance 
companies.  
6.     Establish community public oversight boards to oversee and approve the acquisition 
or use of new surveillance technologies, with powers to approve or reject based on the 
states’ human rights obligations, provisions for public notice and reporting.  
7.     Reform existing laws or introduce new ones that provide remedy for victims of 
unlawful surveillance and ensure that both judicial and non -judicial paths to remedy are 
available i n practice.  
8.  Ensure that national security laws are not misused to justify undue restrictions on 
access to information on the sale, transfer, export, servicing, and use of surveillance 
technologies.  
9.   Implement procurement standards restricting publ ic contracts for surveillance 
technologies and services to only those private surveillance companies which 
demonstrate that they respect human rights in line with the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights and have not facilitated or contribute d to human rights  
abuses.  
10.   Participate in key multilateral efforts to develop robust human rights standards that 
govern the development, sale, use and transfer of surveillance capabilities and 
equipment, and i mpose limitations as to who can be targets  of digital surveillance.  
11.   Inform securities exchanges and financial regulators of the harms associated with 
private surveillance technology companies, and require strict, regular scrutiny in law and 
regulation of disclosures and applications by those  companies and their owners  
Furthermore, before considering the lifting - in part or in whole - of the moratorium, states 
must have in place appropriate legal frameworks and safeguards capable of proving  that 
there is no tangible risk of the technology bei ng used by purchasers, or reasonably 
foreseeable end users, in breach of international human rights law.
