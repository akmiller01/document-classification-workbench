Dear
United
Nation
Secretary-General's
Envoy
on
T echnology ,
JPNIC
and
APNIC
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
make
input
to
the
Global
Digital
Compact.
JPNIC
–
Japan
Network
Information
Center
is
the
National
Internet
Registry
(NIR)
and
the
Internet
Promotion
Body
for
Japan.
APNIC
-
Asia
Pacific
Network
Information
Centre
is
the
Regional
Internet
Registry
(RIR)
for
Asia
Pacific
Region.
As
a
part
of
the
Internet
T echnical
Community ,
these
support
the
sound
operation
of
Internet
Infrastructure
to
achieve
a
prosperous
and
stable
Internet
society .
This
input
is
from
this
point
of
view
and
for
the
area
of
#2
–
A void
internet
fragmentation.
2.
A void
internet
fragmentation
a)
Cor e
Principles
( t h a t
a l l
g o v e r n m e n t s ,
c o m p a n i e s ,
c i v i l
s o c i e t y
o r g a n i s a t i o n s
a n d

s t a k e h o l d e r s
s h o u l d
a d h e r e
t o )
The
Internet
is
a
network
of
networks,
with
many
networks
interconnected
to
function
as
a
single
global
network
as
a
whole.
It
is
achieved
through
the
adoption
of
technical
standards
and
by
enabling
everyone
in
the
world
to
access
the
Internet,
thereby
realizing
its
function
and
value
as
the
Internet.
If
an
internet
fragmentation
occurs,
the
Internet
will
cease
to
function
as
the
Internet
in
the
first
place,
so
it
is
of
utmost
importance
to
avoid
the
fragmentation.
The
Internet
is
the
infrastructure
for
every
nation-state,
company ,
or ganization,
and
individual
on
the
globe
to
communicate
with
each
other .
　
Therefore,
w
e
must
maintain
the
single
global
Internet.
For
this
point,
JPNIC
and
APNIC
fully
support
the
position
which
RIPE
NCC
articulated
in
a
RIPE
Labs
article
“
An
Open
Internet
Remains
the
Goal
”
on
April
6,
2022
1
,
in
the
section
titled
“The
Internet
Runs
on
Consensus"
.
“
Competing
nation-states
and
business
inter ests
have
shar ed
a
single,
global
Internet.
Maintaining
this
has
been
the
need
for
at
least
some
base
layer
of
cooperation,”
as
the
article
points
out.
Although
some
entities
are
taking
measures
to
mitigate
unwanted
traf fic
on
the
Internet
for
security
and
other
purposes,
these
measures
should
be
taken
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
with
the
single
global
Internet
maintained.
b)
Key
Commitment
/
Pledges
/
Actions
(
that
in
your
view
should
be
taken
by
differ ent
stakeholders
–
governments,
private
sector ,
civil
society ,
etc)
The
coordination
bodies
of
the
global
Internet
Infrastructure,
including
ICANN,
IETF ,
and
RIRs,
must
be
able
to
sustain
the
operations
of
administration
of
unique
identifiers
and
development
of
standard
protocols,
independently
from
the
policies
of
particular
nation-states
and
companies.
Necessary
measures
should
be
taken
to
ensure
it.
The
case
that
the
service
of
distributing
IP
addresses
is
subject
to
sanctions
of
a
nation-state's
foreign
policy
is
an
example
that
a
nation-state's
jurisdiction
af fects
the
single
global
Internet.
It
is
important
to
respect
the
independence
and
the
global
impact
of
these
coordination
bodies.
On
the
other
hand,considerations
and
assistance
should
be
given
to
maintaining
the
business
continuity
of
the
coordination
bodies
when
necessary .
