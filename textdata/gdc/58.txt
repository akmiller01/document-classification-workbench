The
CyberPeace
Institute,
an
independent
and
neutral
non
governmental
organization 
headquartered
in
Geneva,
Switzerland,
has
a
mission
to
reduce
the
harms
from 
cyberattacks
on
people’s
lives,
provide
assistance
to
vulnerable
communities,
and
call 
for
responsible
cyber
behavior
and
accountability.
In
a
world
where
the
use
of
digital 
technologies
is
increasingly
becoming
ubiquitous
it
is
important
that
their
use
serves 
humanity
and
does
not
undermine
it.
This
requires
collaboration
and
cooperation.
The
CyberPeace
Institute
welcomes
the
call
for
civil
society
organizations
to
contribute 
to
the
Global
Digital
Compact
and
respectfully
provides
the
following 
recommendations:
1.
Multistakeholder
governance:
Build
on
existing
frameworks,
and 
mainstream
a
multistakeholder
approach
The
Global
Digital
Compact
is
an
opportunity
to
bring
together
different
policy
areas 
and
ﬁelds
of
international
law
within
the
United
Nations
system,
to
increase
coherence 
and
build
on
existing
international
frameworks,
and
to
reinforce
and
reafﬁrm
existing 
commitments
but
should
not
duplicate
existing
work,
mandates
or
norms.
Peace
and
security
in
cyberspace
requires
a
collective
effort
and
meaningful 
multistakeholder
cooperation
including
from
civil
society
organizations,
industry 
actors,
academia,
and
experts.
Civil
society
actors
already
play
a
critical
role
in
the 
provision
of
expertise
and
guidance
in
relation
to
the
stability
of
cyberspace,
the 
impact
on
human
rights
and
people’s
security,
and
are
integral
to
the
functioning
and 
integrity
of
many
of
the
existing
digital
cooperation
frameworks.
Thus,
a 
multistakeholder
approach
to
developing,
and
implementing,
the
Global
Digital 
Compact
should
be
facilitated.
Procedural
modalities
shape
the
substantive 
discussions
and
how
States
interact
with
stakeholders,
and
the
participation
of 
relevant
actors,
including
the
private
sector,
civil
society
and
academia,
should
be 
incorporated
in
a
formal,
comprehensive,
and
systematic
manner.

2.
Apply
human
rights
online:
Ensure
a
human-centric
approach
and
reinforce 
existing
protections
for
human
rights
The
maintenance
of
international
peace
and
security
needs
to
ensure
the
protection 
and
enablement
of
individuals
and
communities
to
enjoy
their
fundamental
rights
and 
freedoms,
including
rights
to
economic
and
social
advancement,
in
cyberspace.
This 
will
require
the
acknowledgment
of
a
human-centric
approach
to
security
of
and
in
the 
use
of
ICTs
and
to
facilitate
a
more
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
impact
and 
harm
of
the
malicious
use
of
ICTs
on
people
and
society.
Human
rights,
protected
by
the
international
human
rights
framework,
are
applicable 
online
and
offline,
yet
digital
technologies
are
being
used
to
restrict
freedoms
and 
violate
human
rights,
for
example,
through
unlawful
surveillance,
disinformation,
hate 
speech
and
online
abuse,
internet
shutdowns,
unlawful
collection
or
misuse
of
data. 
The
Global
Digital
Compact
must
reinforce
the
existing
international
human
rights 
framework,
and
focus
on
implementation
and
advancing
of
human
rights
online, 
including
freedom
of
expression,
non-discrimination,
freedom
of
assembly,
privacy
and 
to
seek,
receive
and
impart
information.
Relevant
international
human
rights 
frameworks
include
the
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
,
the
International 
Covenant
on
Political
and
Civil
Rights
and
the
International
Covenant
on
Economic, 
Social
and
Cultural
Rights
with
their
respective
Protocols,
the
Conventions
1
that
layout 
in
more
detail
these
rights,
and
ﬁnally
the
UN
Guiding
Principles
on
Business
and 
Human
Rights.
It
is
important
that
international
human
rights
law
determines
states’
and
businesses’ 
responses
to
the
use
of
digital
technologies,
for
example,
surveillance
technology
and 
the
use
of
Artiﬁcial
Intelligence.
Increased
transparency
and
accountability
are
very 
important,
and
States
and
businesses
must
take
more
action
in
this
regard.

cybersecurity 
for
collective
security,
safety,

The
cyber
threat
landscape
is
rapidly
evolving
with
a
rise
in
the
frequency, 
sophistication
and
intensity
of
cyberattacks
in
situations
of
armed
conflict
and
peace 
with
the
risk
of
real
harm
to
people,
and
severe
humanitarian
consequences.
Cyberattacks
and
cybercrime
are
exploiting
the
interconnectedness
and
digitalization 
of
our
societies
and
blur
the
boundaries
between
perceptions
of
peace
and
conflict. 
The
security
of
cyberspace
is
essential
for
a
stable
global
system,
thus
action
must
be 
taken
to
strengthen
this
security
with
approaches
that
enhance
trust,
the
rights
of 
people
and
societal
resilience.
The
unique
nature
of
cyberspace
requires
a
collective 
responsibility
from
all
sectors
of
society
to
ensure
the
respect
of
laws,
rights
and 
norms
for
the
protection
of
people.
The
creation
and
dissemination
of
hate
speech,
disinformation
and
misinformation 
undermines
access
to
information,
participation
online,
and
can
constitute
incitement 
to
hostility,
discrimination,
or
violence,
with
devastating
consequences
for
people
and 
communities
online
and
offline.
The
vulnerability
of
different
individuals
and
groups 
differs
according
to
their
exposure
to
a
given
problem,
the
impact
on
them
and
their 
capacity
to
tackle
it.
Religious
and
ethnic
minorities,
and
marginalized
groups
are
often 
disproportionately
impacted,
with
women
and
children
facing
compounding
effects 
linked
to
speciﬁc
vulnerabilities.
Disinformation
and
misinformation
can
also
increase 
the
exposure
of
individuals
or
groups
to
other
risks
and
vulnerabilities,
for
example, 
they
may
not
seek
life-saving
support
or
assistance
from
organizations,
such
as
IOs 
and
NGOs,
due
to
intentionally
misleading
information.
It
is
essential
that
the
Global
Digital
Compact
underscores
the
importance
of
upholding 
respect
for
human
rights.
Governments
and
the
corporate
sector
need
to
respond
to 
curtail
hate
speech,
disinformation
and
misinformation,
with
approaches
that
focus
on 
the
implementation
of
human
rights,
promoting
transparency
and
meaningful 
accountability
accompanied
by
independent
oversight.
In
this
regard,
the
Global 
Digital
Compact
should
play
a
role
in
ensuring
a
data
and
evidence-based
approach, 
including
gender
disaggregated
data,
to
understanding
which
interventions
are 
impactful
to
curtail
hate
speech,
disinformation,
and
misinformation,
to
share
best 
practices,
and
to
improve
digital
skills
of
users
to
identify
and
address
harmful 
material.
Multistakeholder
partnerships
will
be
vital
for
an
effective
and
sustainable 
response
to
the
spread
of
hate
speech,
disinformation
and
misinformation
that
respect 
human
rights
and
a
human
centric
understanding
of
safety
and
security.
In
addition, 
addressing
gender
based
challenges
will
require
transformative
and
inclusive
solutions
and
approaches,
including
to
ensure
women’s
participation.

4.
Avoid
Internet
fragmentation:
Preserve
the
universal
character
of
the
Internet
The
fragmentation
of
the
Internet
creates
boundaries
in
cyberspace.
It
undermines
the 
Internet
as
a
motor
of
economic
and
social
development,
increases
the
risks
of
an 
information
vacuum
and
the
spread
of
misinformation
and
disinformation,
and
poses 
risks
for
the
respect
of
human
rights
and
security.
The
Internet’s
openness
depends 
on
trust
and
this
trust
is
undermined
when
access
to
the
Internet
is
blocked
for 
political
or
other
reasons
including
in
times
of
war
or
other
crises.
The
open,
multistakeholder
model
of
governance
of
the
Internet
through
a
number
of 
different
organizations,
companies
and
international
fora
is
primordial
in
protecting
a 
free,
open
Internet
for
all.
The
Internet’s
strength
is
its
distributed
nature.
All
efforts 
must
be
made
to
preserve
the
universal
character
of
the
internet,
and
to
prevent 
activity
that
damages
the
availability
and/or
integrity
of
the
public
core
of
the
internet. 
In
this
regard,
it
is
critical
that
the
multistakeholder,
decentralized
approaches
to
the 
current
model
of
the
Internet
are
reinforced.
The
Global
Digital
Compact
should
reafﬁrm
the
multistakeholder
decentralized 
approach
for
the
governance
of
the
Internet,
and
preserve
the
principles
of
openness, 
availability,
and
integrity
of
the
Internet.
5.
Connect
all
People:
Digital
Inclusion,
Connectivity,
and
Capacity
Building
People
need
inclusive,
meaningful
and
secure
connectivity,
knowledge
and
tools
to 
ensure
their
ability
to
tap
into
the
potential
of
digital
technologies.
These
conditions 
are
also
critical
to
the
achievement
of
the
Sustainable
Development
Goals
(SDGs). 
Digital
connectivity
is
a
key
enabler
of
social
and
economic
development
and 
underpins
the
achievement
of
the
SDGs,
yet
the
digital
divide
persists.
The
Global 
Digital
Compact
should
support
efforts
to
foster
inclusive
connectivity
and
there
is
a 
critical
need
for
international
cooperation
and
to
understand
in
each
context
the 
factors
that
contribute
to
the
connectivity
gap
and
digital
divide.
Beneﬁting
from
digitalisation
while
strengthening
societal
and
cyber
resilience
requires 
international
collaboration,
capacity
building
at
all
levels
putting
inclusion
and
people 
at
the
center,
addressing
the
digital
divide,
and
the
sharing
of
best
practices
and 
investment.
The
Global
Digital
Compact
should
encourage
and
facilitate
the
development
of 
multistakeholder
solutions
and
cooperation
to
tackle
digital
divides,
promote
digital

awareness,
digital
literacy
and
skills,
cyber-hygiene
and
online
safety
practices.
The 
importance
of
a
multistakeholder
approach
involving
the
public
sector,
international 
organizations,
civil
society,
industry,
and
other
actors
should
be
underscored
by
the 
Global
Digital
Compact
as
essential
to
understanding,
identifying
scalable
solutions 
and
addressing
the
challenges.
The
Global
Digital
Compact
should
encourage
a
multidisciplinary
approach
across 
sectors
including
the
cybersecurity
and
development
communities,
to
achieve
"cyber 
resilience
for
development".
Cybersecurity
needs
to
be
mainstreamed
into
the 
international
development
agenda
as
core
enablers
of
digital,
economic,
and
social
development.
