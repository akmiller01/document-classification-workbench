Open Internet for Democracy Leaders  
Submission to the Global Digital Compact  
Introduction  
Democracy relies on the free flow of ideas, which in the modern age means having an open and 
inclusive internet that allows citizens to freely share their opinions, exchange ideas, and engage in 
public debates and interactive dialogue. Access to an open and inclusive internet is necessary to 
strengthen democratic engagement and governance, promote social accountability, and enable equal 
participation in the market economy.  
Given increasing global reliance on the internet, we believe that the UN Global Digital Compact should 
focus on how an open and accessible internet is fundamental to the success of democratic societies 
worldwide. An open and inclusive internet enhances democratic processes in the following ways:  
● Increases access to information, including news, analysis, and research, that can help individuals 
make more informed decisions in the democratic process.  
● Strengthens political eng agement by enabling individuals to easily contribute to political 
discussions and debates with others, regardless of geographic location.  
● Improves transparency in government decision -making by providing a platform for government 
agencies and officials to share information with the public in real -time.  
● Encourages civic participation by allowing individuals to easily find and connect with community 
groups, political parties, and advocacy organizations that align with their interests and values.  
● Fosters government accountability by enabling individuals to easily track the actions and 
decisions of government officials, including voting records, campaign contributions, and other 
relevant information.  
● Enables remote voting in some cases, which can in crease accessibility and participation in the 
democratic process, particularly for individuals who have mobility or accessibility issues, or who 
are living in remote or rural areas.  
While noting the importance of the internet in democratic societies, we al so need to acknowledge 
existing online threats and harms, including the continuous violation of human rights online, attacks on 
information integrity, cybercrime and data breaches, violence against women online, as well as 
widening gaps in the digital divi de. These challenges, among others, have impeded the advancement of 
democratic participation both online and offline.

In the pursuit of outlining shared principles for an open, free, and secure digital future for all that 
protects democracy in the digit al age, this submission focuses on the following thematic topics and the 
ways in which they intersect with democratic norms and values:  
1. Apply Human Rights Online  
2. Avoid Internet Fragmentation  
3. Digital Commons as a Public Good  
4. Protect Data  
5. Regulation of Artif icial Intelligence  
Multistakholderism has proven to be the most effective model for internet governance and 
accountability. There must be action and adherence from all digital actors, both public and private, in 
order to secure a free and inclusive interne t that benefits all of humanity. Given the vital importance of 
multistakeholder participation in the development of global norms and standards that help shape the 
future of the internet, this document outlines how diverse stakeholder groups can work togeth er to 
protect democracy in the digital age. Under each key theme, we provide recommendations on how 
stakeholder groups such as government, civil society, media, and the private sector can engage with one 
another to ensure the advancement of a democratic di gital space.  
We welcome the opportunity to contribute our input to the Global Digital Compact. Our goal is to share 
experiences from grassroots communities, democratic reformers, youth, and other stakeholders who 
have been working to advance digital rights .

Avoid internet fragmentation  
Overview  
The global democratic potential of the internet can only be realized if all citizens around the world have 
access to an open, interoperable network. The internet is a platform for citizens to access diverse views 
and opinions and also to create deeper soci al engagements and mobilize. Internet fragmentation is the 
process of breaking up the internet into smaller, independent networks. It can be caused by a variety of 
factors, including government impulse for “digital sovereignty,” commercial competition, and  technical 
incompatibility.  
Whatever the impetus, internet fragmentation restricts the flow of news and information and places 
barriers on cross -border transfers of user data, and in practice centralizes state control over internet 
governance and infrastru cture.1 It also restricts access to information and knowledge which in turn also 
limits the exercise of socio -economic rights and political and civil rights online. For example, internet 
fragmentation can expose marginalized groups to potential harm by limiting access to critical 
information needed to combat institutionalized discrimination, creating barriers to participating in the 
global digital economy, and exacerbating vulnerabilities to surveillance, censorship, and discrimination. 
It can also aggra vate discrimination and harassment of groups based on their intersectional identities, 
such as ethnicity, race, religion, gender/sexuality, caste, or social class by enabling governments or 
other actors to more easily target and isolate specific groups.  
Key Principles  
● An open, interoperable global internet is a fundamental tool for exercising human rights  
● Mutlistakeholder governance is essential to avoid internet fragmentation  
Recommendations  
Governments : 
● Endorse and meaningfully engage in multistakeholder internet governance processes at the 
international, regional, and national level  
● Avoid laws, policies, and government regulations that would lead to internet fragmentation  
● Invest in capacity building of government agencies to enable them to have a better 
understanding of the negative impacts of internet fragmentation, including the increased risk of 
cyberattacks as a fragmented internet as a patchwork of different cybersecurity standards and 
practices can create weaknesses attackers can exploit

Digital Commons as a Public Good  
Overview  
Democracy depends on engagement and interaction, which is why the global digital commons should be 
protected as a public good. The internet – which is itself built upon networking protocols in the common 
domain – has generated a digital commons that is also a driver of knowledge exchange and innovation. 
This in turn, spurs social and economic progress, and is a foundation for democratic development.2 
Protectin g the digital commons is important for both democratic development and human 
development. As UN Secretary -General António Guterres has declared “it is important that all actors, 
including Member States, the United Nations system, the private sector and oth er stakeholders, 
promote open -source software, open data, open artificial intelligence models, open standards and open 
content that adhere to privacy and other applicable international and domestic laws, standards and best 
practices and do no harm.”3 In so doing, all stakeholders can collaborate to create a digital commons 
that can serve all of humanity.  
Key Principles  
● The digital commons must be fostered and maintained through investment in technologies and 
a commitment to open standards  
● The digital commo ns should be open and accessible to all, without discrimination or exclusion 
based on factors such as race, gender, socio -economic status, or geography  
● Collaboration is essential to the functioning of the digital commons, as it enables individuals an d 
comm unities to work together to create and share digital resources  
Recommendations  
Governments:  
● Create national policies on digital infrastructure that account for the creation and use of digital 
public goods  
● Utilize open source software and open networking protocols  
● Be transparent about the development of digital commons, and consult with multiple 
stakeholders during the development, deployment and review phases to prevent 
monopolization of power on digital commons  
● Create policies that result in n on-classified resources built or created using public funds to be in 
open licensing

Protect data  
Overview  
Data protection and privacy online is fundamental to the success of democracy as it builds trust among 
internet users. The increased reliance of the online space has created an unprecedented amount of data 
that is collected, processed, stored, and shared across the internet. This is especially  true since the 
beginning of the COVID -19 pandemic, when many social and economic activities transitioned online. 
With the abundance of data production and sharing, especially data that is personally identifiable, it is 
more important than ever to ensure t hat data protection and privacy are prioritized. Without these 
protections in place, there is an increased chance of unethical hacking, data interception, and identity 
theft which erodes trust in the digital space.  
Key principles  
● Prioritize the privacy rig hts of internet users  
● Provide safety and security measures within technologies that help protect personally 
identifiable and sensitive information  
● Build transparency and accountability across stakeholders including governments and 
businesses on how data is  collected, processed, stored, shared, and disposed Recommendations  
Governments:  
● Engage with civil society, the private sector, and independent media to develop and implement 
data protection policies that follow a human rights centric approach and align wi th international 
standards  
● Implement a process or mechanism that ensures any collection, usage, or storage of personal 
data is necessary and aligns with international human rights frameworks  
● Repeal laws or provisions that criminalize encryption  
● Create legi slation and safeguards that prohibit governments from undertaking unjustified mass 
surveillance  
Civil Society:  
● Raise awareness on data protection, and tools and practices for data protection such as data 
recovery systems, data backup systems, firewalls, an d anti -virus software  
● Review proposed data protection frameworks to ensure adherence to human rights standards  
● Collaborate with technologists to inform the development of new technology that prioritizes 
data protection and privacy by design  
● Raise awareness  of best practices for digital safety and security, especially for high -risk users like 
journalists, human rights defenders, and activists  
 
 
11 
 
Private Sector:  
● Develop internal policies or guidelines on data protection and privacy, and ensure data that is 
collected for business purposes is prioritized  
● Communicate with customers/users on how their data is collected, stored, or shared. When 
possible, allow customers/users to opt in and agree to how their personal data will be used to 
maximize transparency  
● Engage with civil society, independent media, and government in policy conversations focused 
on the development and implementation of new legislation on data privacy and protection. This 
engagement can help ensure that legislation on data privacy and protecti on not only adheres to 
human rights frameworks, but are feasible in terms of implementation across the business 
community.  
Media:  
● Promote investigative journalism that highlights emerging data protection issues or concerns 
raised by internet users  
● Engage w ith diverse stakeholder groups, such as civil society, the private sector, and 
government to raise awareness on how data privacy and protection is essential for journalists 
and the broader media development community

Regulation of Artificial Intelligence  
Overview  
Artificial intelligence -based applications are influencing democratic processes at various levels including 
digitized civic engagement, content recommender systems, electoral content moderation, voter 
registration, verifica tion and counting of votes.4 It is crucial to analyze the opportunities and challenges 
of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) before its large -scale adoption by different stakeholders, while also 
being critical about the hype that goes with the term “a rtificial intelligence.”  
Impacts of these powerful technologies require additional research, especially on how they affect 
democracy. This includes research and dialogue on the impact of deploying large scale AI -based 
technologies as well as the adoption o f digital ID systems. In addition, there is a need to consider 
aspects of inclusion, intersectionality, as well as the environmental costs of AI.  
Key Principles:  
● The development and implementation of AI should not impede on digital rights essential for 
dem ocratic processes  
● Specific regulations for AI should be created based on the application, technology used, and 
sector, and incorporate public -interest auditing mechanisms  
● Human review should be possible for decisions made or informed by AI systems in civil  rights -
related matters  
● Clear accountability must be established for AI systems used in decision -making that can impact 
civil liberties Recommendations  
Governments:  
● Invest in AI research and promote development of human -centered and human rights based AI  
● Investigate and legislate to ensure that the environmental costs of AI are minimized  
● Adhere to international commitments related to AI, through concrete policy, legislation, 
national budgets, and other executive policy instruments  
● Ensure anti -discriminatio n and anti -bias frameworks are built into AI regulatory instruments  
● Establish independent government agencies/standard setting bodies in collaboration with civil 
society/public interest technologists to review AI -based technologies and publish the results of 
such reviews

● Train policymakers and media professionals on the need to appropriately regulate AI  
● Collaborate with academia to ensure that various stakeholders are aware of the risks presented 
by the use of AI systems in easy and accessible formats  
● Campaign a gainst the use and practice of profiling using AI -based tools to prevent government 
limitation on freedoms  
Private sector:  
● Commit to transparency about the AI tools that are developed and deployed. This includes 
collaborating with the media to report on ne w tools or features that are released  
● Consider privacy and human rights implications in the design of any AI -based technology tool or 
platform  
● Create AI -based products that can be used to bridge information gaps, especially for 
marginalized communities, su ch as people with disabilities, people of diverse genders, etc. and 
improve their access to public services  
● Conduct regular reviews and assessments to ensure AI tools respect human rights. Key findings 
of impact assessments and audits of AI tools can also be published to build trust and 
transparency  
Media:  
● Conduct reporting on the development of AI, and both its social benefits and potential harms  
● Examine the implications of AI on the practice of journalism to make sure that the power of AI is 
used in line with long -held journalistic ethics

Conclusion: The Value of Multistakeholder Democratic Digital  
Governance  
As the online space continues to evolve at an exponential rate, there has never been a more urgent 
need to promote democratic digital governance. At the same time, ensuring the protection of 
democracy and human rights in the digital age can only be achieved through multistakeholder dialogue 
and collaboration, which is at the core of the recommendations and principles listed throughout th is 
document. Continuous coordination across diverse stakeholder groups is essential to build trust, 
exchange ideas, and reach consensus on a wide range of issues impacting the future of democracy 
online. We thank the United Nations Office of the Envoy on T echnology for taking these principles and 
recommendations into consideration.
