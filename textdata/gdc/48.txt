UN Global Digital Compact Digital Commons as a Global Public Good   About WBA The World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) was launched around the 2018 UN General Assembly and is built on a strong commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. WBA aims to build a movement to measure and incentivise business impact towards a sustainable future that works for everyone. We do this by developing free and publicly available benchmarks that assess the performance of 2,000 of the world’s most influential companies, ranking and measuring them on their contributions to the SDGs. Our assessments equip governments, financial institutions, companies, civil society and individuals with the evidence-based insights they need to influence company sustainability performance. In this way, these benchmarks help reward leaders and hold laggards to account through collective action with the WBA Alliance of 330+ multi-stakeholder organisations, including multilateral organisations, civil society, business platforms, academia, and investors. We believe that the role of businesses is critical to deliver sustainable development and support resilient societies worldwide. However, currently we  lack robust mechanisms to hold the planet’s most influential companies accountable for their impact on people and the planet. This corporate accountability gap is an important limitation of global governance today, as it hinders multilateralism from achieving Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement. To reach the ambitions set out in Our Common Agenda, it will be essential to strengthen corporate accountability mechanisms to ensure progress in support of global agendas; and to embed this function of corporate accountability in the intergovernmental system, including regarding digital inclusion and algorithmic accountability.  The Collective Impact Coalition for Digital Inclusion WBA launched the concept for Collective Impact Coalitions (CICs) in 2021, to provide a space for Allies and stakeholders to take forward cross-sector, collaborative action based on data and evidence provided by WBA benchmarks. These CICs are multi-stakeholder and timebound, bringing together diverse actors from large institutional investors to civil society, academia and business platforms to coordinate and collaborate on actions to drive positive changes on systemically important topics. These CICs are key to ensuring corporate accountability on sustainable development. From 2022 onwards, the Collective Impact Coalition for Digital Inclusion has focused on driving measurable progress on corporate commitment to ethical AI and human rights principles, especially among the 130 digital technology companies that were found to be lacking any such  commitment. In doing so, the Coalition encourages a positive change in industry business practices, enhancing business responsibility for an inclusive and trustworthy digital transformation.  Participants in the Digital CIC have driving forward the adoption of ethical AI and human rights principles among the companies in their portfolio, see the Investor Statement on Ethical AI and the statement with civil

societies, research, think tanks and business groups. There will be more CIC actions happening throughout the year, including holding awareness creation events, online campaigns among others.   Digital CIC Inputs to the UN Global Digital Compact   Objective 1: Connect all people to the internet 1. The UN Global Digital Compact must strengthen both global and locally rooted commitment to ensure that everyone who desires have access to technology without discrimination on sex, age, gender, religion, and ethnicity and other characteristics relevant in national context while respecting the right to privacy in the digital space, which standards are universally recognised under Art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which further reaffirmed in UN Human Rights Council Resolution Resolution No. 34/7 on the right to privacy in the digital age (A/HRC/RES/34/7). The UN Global Digital Compact should also generate evidence-based actions that ensure this commitment flows into efforts to increase internet coverage beyond the 51% of the current world population already having access. To realise this commitment, the Global Digital Compact must reflect the following items: (a)  Acknowledge private sector’s critical role in a digitally transformed world and strategies for the provision of universal access to technologies and meaningful connectivity to all people, including children at schools and vulnerable groups; (b) Develop a comprehensive strategy for improving access to technology and meaningful connectivity that innovatively minimises the digital's growing environmental footprint  with the participation of all relevant UN bodies, intergovernmental organisations, and non-profit organisations, along with private sectors at local, national, regional, and global levels aimed at accelerating technology access and improving digital capabilities (digital literacy and skills, and invention)  of technology beneficiaries; (c)Increase funding and training for official national and regional data stewards for data collection that captures, the digital divide, intersectional inequalities, and the current state of technology access and use to create evidence-based interventions to narrow the digital divide, improve digital technology access, use, solutions and digital capabilities so that no one is left behind, and; (d)Encourage the UN Regional Commissions (in Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, and Western Asia) to support the development of regional and national programmes for minimising the digital divide between countries and communities at all levels; along with collaboration with all relevant UN Agencies and intergovernmental organisations at country and regional levels to ensure adherence to local context and wisdom.

Objective 2: Apply human rights online 2. The UN Global Digital Compact must affirm that the standards of the rights to equality, privacy, and non-discrimination within the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights are applied to the online space, and the call for actors within the digital ecosystem to commit to protecting human rights online are explicitly prescribed within the instrument. In the digital age, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights as set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework. The importance of annual scorecards and metrics to measure digital inclusion and efforts to protect human rights online should be established to accelerate the promotion of an inclusive digital ecosystem based on the Secretary General’s Digital Roadmap which acknowledges that “A set of metrics to measure digital inclusion will be essential for evidence-based policymaking...” To realise these commitments, the Global Digital Compact should: (a)   Ensure that accountability to protect human rights in the digital space is shared between regulators, private companies, and non-profit organisations through establishing a consultative process at national, regional, and global levels that aim to mainstream the embodiment of human rights principles throughout the business process, products, and services; (b)   Encourage mutually-beneficial and regular data and insights-sharing to map, assess, and act on the human rights impacts of technology, and; (c)   Develop joint national and regional programmes between governments, private sectors, and UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to increase awareness of human rights fulfilment in the digital space and prevention of online human rights violations.   Objective 3: Regulation of Artificial Intelligence 3. The UN Global Digital Compact should encourage frameworks grounded on human rights-based principles for the basic ethical human rights-based use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all its forms by governments and digital technology businesses amid a rapidly changing and accelerating digital society all over the world. To realise this commitment, the Global Digital Compact must: (a)   Encourage governments at national, regional, and global levels to come up with guidelines on ethical human rights-based AI standards to ensure that machine learning tools are used in accordance with human rights principles and further mainstream the regulatory framework to ensure that standards are coherent in different geographics and across borders; (b) Establish national, regional, and global accountability mechanisms that track the performances of digital technology companies and platforms and disclose their commitment and actions aligned with ethical human rights-based AI principles, and; c) Develop formal mechanisms/ inclusive frameworks to ensure meaningful participation of official representatives from countries with less AI maturity in the global AI governance

decisions. Engaging developing countries in the international AI governance agenda is critical to ensure that their voices are heard, they receive support to address their specific needs, lessen the administrative burden of global norms that are not reflective of less developed AI ecosystems, and for the effective participation in the process of standard-setting, legislation, and regulation of global AI governance.   Objective 4. Protect Data The UN Global Digital Compact must promote the advancement of human-rights-based data governance as a component of upholding data justice.1 Lack of transparency around data collection heightens the risk of its misuse and can lead to practices that are discriminatory and/or in violation of human rights. It is therefore imperative to ensure that the collection, use, and re-use of data reflect the contextual realities of a modern, diverse, and interdependent global data system.    To realise this commitment, the UN Global Digital Compact must: (a)  Encourage governments at national and global levels to strengthen their data governance policies to recognise the way that data is collected at all levels of their populations; (b) Apply a Business and Human Rights approach (the aforementioned ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ framework) to the implementation of data protection policies; (c) Work with businesses to ensure transparency on how they collect, use and store data throughout their operations and conduct due diligence on how they are collecting and using data down the supply chain and throughout the data lifecycle;  (d) Develop formal mechanisms to support diverse civil society organisations (CSOs) in understanding and advocating for a data justice framework and bolster efforts to increase collaborative efforts between academia and CSOs to boost data literacy and knowledge of data rights, as well as capacities to innovate locally in local communities, and; (e) Develop a multistakeholder data justice approach to governing data that ensures the private sector mitigates and is accountable for negative implications that arise from commercially driven institutional and organizational uses of data at different points in the data value chain and life cycle.           1 A data justice approach is one that centres on equity, recognition and representation of plural interests, and the creation and preservation of public goods as its principal goals.https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951717736335
