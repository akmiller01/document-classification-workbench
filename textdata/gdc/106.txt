In comparison to 2012 where only 2.4 billion people were internet users, today the number of internet users globally have increased to 5.3 billion people who have access to connecBvity.1 With this signiﬁcant growth of internet adopBon, our world also has gone through rapid eﬀorts for digital transformaBon as evidently seen through the digitalizaBon of idenBBes, the pandemic’s shiG to e-learnings, to the use of Web3 technologies to push for transparency. Our world has undeniably become interconnected and the role of digital technologies to support our livelihood is further strengthened.  The Power and Poten-al of the Most Connected Genera-on  At the forefront of this digital advancement, is the world’s most connected generation: young people. Today, 75 per cent of people aged between 15 and 24 are users of the internet2, making them a generation of digital natives. Uniquely, at least 25% of today’s 8 billion population are made up of children under the age of 14 who never experienced life before the internet existed 3, while 1.2 billion of the world’s young people in general have grown up through the internet advancement era. As digital natives, the experience and relationship between young people of today and digital technologies are unique in comparison to generations before them – such as Generation X, who most likely had to learn to navigate the internet and technology beyond their youth. This specific experience naturally makes young people of today both at leverage and at risk.   Growing up with the background of digital advancements has enabled young people to have competitive advantages in adopting and utilizing technologies to pursue education, employment, and aspirations. Young people of today often turn to digital learning opportunities to strengthen their digital skills. Youth-led grassroots movements have relied on social media and online messaging platforms to mobilize actions and advocacies for pertinent issues, such as the climate crisis. Around the world, with open source, blockchain, virtual reality, and other frontier technologies young people have risen to the challenge of creating innovative solutions that could contribute to sustainable development goals efforts.   The competitive advantage young people have as a generation of digital natives is not only making young people users of technologies but also drivers and inventors of technologies. When developing new features and products, technology companies look to young people as young people of today significantly hold the power of shaping the infrastructure influence. It is noted that young people significantly influence, by 63%, how the world receives and consumes news4  1 Global Connec+vity Report 2022, ITU (2022) 2 Global Connec+vity Report 2022, ITU (2022) 3 World Popula+on Data Dashboard, UNFPA (2023)  4 Trust Barometer Special Report: The New Cascade of Inﬂuence, Edelman (2022) 
 
 today.  The significance of young people’s power, potential, and influence on technologies have rightly made young people key stakeholders of digital development.  Hindering Barriers   However, despite the leverages that young people hold in the digital era, young people are not yet free from challenges, barriers, and harm:  Structural barriers  Despite being the most connected generation, intra-generational inequality still persists. While young people in middle-income countries drive the digital transformation, accessibility and affordability remain key constraints in low-income countries5.  
 ITU Global Connectivity Report 2022 Beyond access, competence in navigating digital aspect is equally important as highlighted by the UNESCO Global Framework on Digital Literacy6. The framework highlighted the need for comprehensive literacy that includes competency not only in digital information literacy, but also competency in the aspect of safety and problem solving through digital technologies.  5 Global Connec+vity Report 2022, ITU (2022) 6 Global Framework on Digital Literacy, UNESCO (2018) 

 
  Evidently, many young people are still lacking the opportunity to learn comprehensive digital literacy through their education system, in particular the competence of being able to fight misinformation, protect data, privacy, and wellbeing in online space. In a recent Amnesty International youth survey, 93% of respondents noted they have encountered misinformation and 86% respondent also have experienced blocking users in response to content they  would not want to be exposed to7.  The gap in comprehensive and quality digital literacy and skills have also hindered young people who are often left behind to maximize their contribution to technology development, as well as hindered youth in leveraging from digital opportunities and innovation.   Lack of Protec2on of Human Rights Online  In 2023, over 80,000 young people from around the world participated in the U-Report survey on digital future. According to the findings, access for everyone remains the top concern for young people, however control of data and information (21%) and protection of human rights online (15%) are two other priority issues8 that young U-Reporters highlighted.   The harm and risks that young people and children experience in the digital world as rights holders are as real as the harm and risks experienced offline. The Global Protection of Young People in Civic Space9 noted 78% of the survey respondents reported having experienced some form of digital threats, 18% have also reported they experienced them constantly.                                            U-Report on Digital Future 2023     Findings from UNDP’s regional survey10 also highlighted the alarming threats of harmful contents online, young activists expressed that fake news (85%) and extremists' content online (73%) are the top two challenges that they face when they participate and engage online.    7 Children and Youth Social Media Survey, Amnesty Interna+onal (2023)  8 Designed by youth: the architects of our digital future, UNICEF Innova+on (2023) 9  If I Disappear Global Report on Protec+ng Young People in Civic Space, United Na+ons (2021) 10 Civic Par+cipa+on of Youth in the Digital World, UNDP (2021) 

 
 Young people’s concerns over the digital future as well as the risks that they face also varies according to their diverse and intersectional lived identities. 23% of non-binary U-Reporters noted that the most important issue for the future of digital technology is to not restrict their opportunities11, while a young female reporter noted that "It worries me that technology will be replacing humans." (Female U-Reporter, Indonesia, 17).  Exclusion of Youth in Policies and Processes    Moreover, in addition to structural barriers and lack of human-rights protection online, the policies and programmes on digital technology often exclude young people and children. It is noted that to begin with, young people are often traditionally excluded in policymaking processes. While nearly half of the world's population is under 30, only 2.6% of parliamentarians are under the age of 3012.  Despite the fact that young people are the most connected generation, current digital policies too frequently fail to take young people’s perspectives and demands into consideration and young people have regularly voiced their concern over the continuous exclusion and lack of meaningful representation. For example, in a global survey of 250 adolescents, some have specifically highlighted that youth were often consulted but were not considered to be decision-makers in the process of shaping AI technologies and policies 13.   Moreover, in a broader ICT regulation context, only 16% out of 134 countries14 have separate regulatory authority for issues related to the internet in their country and 5.1% of 169 countries15 reported that informal coordination is still the mechanisms of collaboration with the ICT regulator.

 Opportuni/es and Recommenda/ons  Rethinking the Digital Future requires Partnership with Digital Na-ves  When asked about the one most important rule that young people hope to have to help shape their digital future, young people highlighted the rule on data protecBon is one of the key prioriBes, along with AI governance. However, out of the nearly 80,000 respondents of the U-Report survey, only 3 out of 10 feel they have much control about the digital future.16   This highlights the reality that young people con2nue to have cri2cal concern about technology and feel le7 out of the process to shape the digital future.      U-Report on Digital Future 2023  The Global Digital Compact is an opportunity to set standard of key principles in developing and implemenBng rights-respecBng digital soluBons. More importantly, the Global Digital Compact is a key opportunity to develop a unifying normaBve framework for digital development centered in inclusivity, equity, and accountability which can be applied by all Compact members regardless of the size, nature or locaBon of the organizaBon.   Building on the many recommendaBons young people have led, developed, and presented on the topic of digital development and the future of technology across all topics from connecBvity17 and digital future18, ArBﬁcial Intelligence19 , online protecBon20, skills and educaBon21 , equality22, to environment23 through various UN processes, as well as the recommendaBons and ideas young people have voiced through their work on the ground, the global digital compact should help  16 Designed by youth: the architects of our digital future, UNICEF Innova+on (2023) 17 IGF Youth Message, Internet Governance Forum (2022) 18 My Digital Future, Genera+on Connect Youth Call to Ac+on , ITU (2022)  19 Mul+stakeholder AI development: 10 building blocks for inclusive policy design, UNESCO, i4Policy (2022) 20 If I Disappear Global Report on Protec+ng Young People in Civic Space, United Na+ons (2021) 21  Transforming Educa+on Summit Youth Declara+on, United Na+ons (2022) 22 Genera+on Equality Ac+on Coali+on, Genera+on Equality Forum (2021) 23 COP27 Global Youth Statement – Declara+on for Climate Jus+ce, YOUNGO (2022) 

 
 guide the policymaking process and development and/or innovaBon technological soluBons by ensuring:   RECOMMENDATION 1  “Human rights as a non-nego/able aspect must be respected, protected, and remain at the center of all digital developments.”  • As digital development rapidly evolves, the threat against human rights also signiﬁcantly increases. Development of technology and innovaBon without taking human rights into account will undoubtedly widen inequality and set back united eﬀorts to bring the world together. It is therefore important for the Global Digital Compact to acknowledge human rights as a non-negoBable aspect of digital development, speciﬁcally by:   Strengthening Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA). • Foster rights-respecBng technologies by developing a standard of key principles for internet governance and digital technology regulaBons to uphold human rights and their deliberate protecBon and enable all stakeholder of technologies to be safe, protected, and empowered.   Ensuring the implementa;on of the Do No Harm principle. • Foster commitments across all stakeholders to technologies that are free from bias and inequaliBes, including but not limited to, bias and discriminaBon based on based on age, ethnicity, gender idenBty, sexual orientaBon, visible and invisible disability. • Host regular mulBstakeholder consultaBons, in parBcular with diverse groups of young people, to understand the trends of threats against human rights that appear in online civic spaces.  Upholding jus;ce. • Foster commitments across stakeholders to uphold jusBce and equality by thoroughly and imparBally invesBgate threats and acts of inBmidaBon and/or violaBon against human rights online, including hate speech and online discriminaBon. Promo;ng inten;onal technological interven;on. • Foster the culture of being intenBonal in the process of technological developments to ensure all technological products and digital developments can truly serve a posiBve purpose for people and planet, aligned with the principles of responsible producBon and consumpBon.  
 
  RECOMMENDATION 2  “Inclusive and Meaningful Engagement of all Stakeholders, in par/cular Young People must be ensured.”  • NoBng the signiﬁcance of young people as key stakeholders of technology and their role as present and future leaders in digital development, the Global Digital Compact should aim to mainstream meaningful youth engagement principles24 in both the Compact development process as well as the implementaBon of the Compact principles and framework:   
   o Ins%tu%onally mandated: Formally recognized the insBtuBonal responsibility of UN as leading insBtuBon to engage young people in its work on technology and digital development through oﬃcial modaliBes.  o Rights-based and safe: Ensuring young people are recognized and informed as right holders as well as ensuring educaBon of their rights and protecBon both online and oﬄine are accessible.  o Designated: Reserved seats for diverse youth representaBon as key stakeholders at all levels of engagement o Resourced: Recognizing youth engagement and parBcipaBon should not be burdened to youth as rightsholders and commilng to provide adequate resources to enable meaningful youth parBcipaBons  o Transparent, accessible, and voluntary: Engagement opportuniBes for young people should be made available in transparent, accessible, and voluntary manners.  24  Our Common Agenda Policy Brief 3: Meaningful Youth Engagement in Policymaking and Decision-making Processes, United Na+ons (2023) 

 
 Expressions of interest, should be available in local languages and accessible to marginalized youth, including young people with disabiliBes.  o Informa%ve: Young people should be well informed on the roles, processes, and responsibiliBes of their parBcipaBon and engagement  o Reciprocal accountability: Young people should have the opportunity to give and receive feedback in a way that is safe and transparent o Diversity and inclusion: Ensure inclusiveness, pay amenBon to gender balance and engage youth who are tradiBonally underserved.  o Youth as partners: Support young people’s leadership by facilitaBng opportuniBes for decision-making in all stages of programs and iniBaBves. This includes working with adolescent and youth-led organisaBons as a core partner at every level, ensuring that these roles are clearly deﬁned, and young people are adequately supported in every way to ensure that they can inﬂuence decisions.  • Following from the recommendaBons put forth in the policy brief on Meaningful Youth Engagement, the Global Digital Compact should consider how it can mainstream the implementaBon of these principles, to serve as one strong example of how young people can be meaningfully integrated into mulBlateral decision-making processes in the digital realm. In this way, the establishment of the Compact can serve as a key connector in demonstraBng what best pracBce for meaningful youth engagement looks like in the context of the UN’s intergovernmental processes and its vast work on digital technology and innovaBon.  • Through the establishment of UN Youth Oﬃce and the system-wide implementaBon of UN Youth Strategy, Youth203025, the Oﬃce of the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology should   leverage on “One UN” approach to foster the UN’s insBtuBonal commitment to mainstream meaningful youth engagement in supporBng the Global Digital Compact’s development process and implementaBon.  Including by exploring diﬀerent modaliBes of youth meaningful parBcipaBon, such as establishing an empowered youth councils and advisories, as well as establishing and/or supporBng exisBng youth-led themaBc coaliBons for technologies (such as youth-led coaliBon for digital safety, AI, and human rights online).   • To further align with the UN Secretary-General’s Policy Brief on Meaningful Youth Engagement26, the Global Digital Compact should support the recommendaBon to establish a standing United NaBons Youth Townhall as one of the key mechanisms for youth to contribute the development and implementaBon of the Global Digital Compact. More importantly, the Digital Compact should also aim to ensure accessibility is available  25 UN Youth Strategy, Youth2030, United Na+ons (2018) 26 Our Common Agenda Policy Brief 3: Meaningful Youth Engagement in Policymaking and Decision-making Processes, United Na+ons (2023) 
 
 in all engagements that young people are taking part in, especially in regard to ensuring disability inclusion and language translaBons available.  • Lastly, the Global Digital Compact should also leverage on ongoing joint collaboraBon of UN partners, such as the Oﬃce of the Secretary-General's Envoy on Youth, UNICEF InnovaBon, ITU, UNESCO, OHCHR, UN InnovaBon Network, and all relevant UN partners to foster a collaboraBve approach in supporBng young people’s parBcipaBon of the Global Digital Compact implementaBon. Moreover, the UN interagency work on the intersecBon of youth and technology, such as Giga27, ProtecBon through Online ProtecBon (POP)28 iniBaBve, U-Report29, Partner2Connect30, GeneraBon Connect31, GeneraBon Equality AcBon CoaliBon on Technology32, and others should be encouraged to be further expanded and to build on synergies. Advocacy for interagency and mulBstakeholder collaboraBons in and with the UN can be further strengthened to encourage impacqul partnerships for digital future that could posiBvely contribute to the Digital Compact implementaBon.    RECOMMENDATION 3  “Adequate resources to empower young people as equal partners of digital development must be secured.”  • When empowered and equipped with resources and support, the young generaBon of today presents the untapped potenBal of 1.2 billion changemakers that can help bring posiBve and impacqul contribuBon digital technology.  • However, it is imperaBve that the criBcal gaps in digital literacy, persisBng gender digital divide, and inadequate youth representaBon in technology policies and governance are addressed. The Digital Compact presents a unique opportunity to mobilize joint acBon across stakeholders to address these challenges by:  o Ensuring resources to enable young people’s access to meaningful connecBvity and technological infrastructure; quality educaBon on digital literacy and skills; and equal opportuniBes for every youth, especially tradiBonally marginalized young people as these three key components are fundamental to help accelerate  27 GIGA Ini+a+ve, UNICEF (2019) 28 Protec+on through Online Par+cipa+on, ITU and Oﬃce of the UN Special Representa+ve of the Secretary General on Violence Against Children (2021) 29 U-Report Plaborm, UNICEF (2023) 30 Partner2Connect Coali+on, ITU (2021) 31 Genera+on Connect Ini+a+ve, ITU (2021) 32 Genera+on Equality Ac+on Coali+on, Genera+on Equality Forum (2020) 
 
 youth engagement and co-create the digital future. Moreover, digital commons should be made accessible to young people in all their diversity to support young people’s meaningful parBcipaBon in the digital world.   o Mobilizing mulBstakeholder partnerships that leverage on unique strengths of partners across sectors to close the ﬁnancing gaps that oGen hinder the availability of the resources above. More importantly, further encourage public-private partnership to be commimed in joining forces to make adequate and earmarked funding for the engagement of young people available, so young people do not have ﬁnancial barriers to parBcipate in the decision-making process on shaping the digital future.  o Encouraging Member States to consider introducing quotas in relevant decision-making bodies with the aim of increasing youth parBcipaBon in shaping naBonal ICT regulaBons and policies to be inclusive, equal, and future-ﬁt. The representaBon should have an adequate gender balance, and ensure the parBcipaBon and inclusion of minority, indigenous and other underrepresented youth communiBes.   
 
  Way Forward  The Our Common Agenda recommendaBon to create a Global Digital Compact is not only a criBcal recommendaBon, but also notably a Bmely one. The mulBdimensional challenges of the world such as the threat to human rights and equality – to the triple planetary crisis, currently shape the direcBon of digital development into a road full of risks for present and future generaBons.   The Global Digital Compact’s key strength lies on its ambiBon to foster meaningful and impacqul collaboraBon across all stakeholders for a bemer state of technology in our upcoming future. As the world conBnues to navigate the best way to move forward through partnerships and collaboraBons, the digital naBves of today are already pulng their recommendaBons, commitments and ambiBons forward to support this work. Engaging young people as equal partner is key to ensure the global ambiBon to have a bemer, safer, and free digital future for all.
