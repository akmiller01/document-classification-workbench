5   ABSTRACT This paper focuses on BSM Academy's commitment to empowering gender-based violence survivors through digital literacy and promoting equity in internet access and usage. Gender-based violence affects individuals of all genders, with women and girls being disproportionately affected. Survivors of GBV often face significant barriers to accessing resources and support, including digital resources. Digital literacy can play a crucial role in helping survivors of GBV to access the resources they need and to participate in the digital economy. This commitment is in line with the UN Global Digital Compact's focus on universal access and internet fragmentation and its support for organizations like BSM Academy in opening their platforms to provide resources and support for survivors of GBV. We acknowledge the respondents of our survey, BSM volunteers and contributors, program partners, and sponsors for their invaluable support in empowering gender-based violence survivors through digital literacy.              
 
6  CONTEXT  I. GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE SURVIVORS & DIGITAL ECONOMY Gender-based violence (GBV) is a widespread issue that affects people of all genders, with women and girls being disproportionately impacted. Survivors of GBV face significant barriers in accessing resources and support, including digital resources. To address this issue, BSM Academy has developed a digital literacy workshop specifically tailored for GBV survivors. This program aims to empower survivors by providing them with the tools and resources needed to access digital resources and participate in the digital economy. BSM Academy's commitment to digital literacy for GBV survivors aligns with the United Nations Global Digital Compact's mission to promote universal access and eliminate internet fragmentation. This paper will explore BSM Academy's commitment to empowering GBV survivors through digital literacy and their alignment with the UN Global Digital Compact's goals.  II. THE GLOBAL DIGITAL COMPACT OF THE UN The Global Digital Compact is a call to action for governments, the United Nations system, the private sector, civil society, grassroots organizations, academia, and individuals, including youth, to collaborate in creating an open, free, and secure digital future for all. The Common Agenda report identifies seven key areas on which stakeholders are invited to submit inputs, with the aim of outlining shared principles and commitments to address these issues. These areas include: 1. connecting all people to the internet, including all schools, 2. avoiding internet fragmentation, 3. protecting data, 4. applying human rights online, 5. promoting accountability for discrimination and misleading content, 6. regulating artificial intelligence, and 7. recognizing the digital commons as a global public good. BSM Academy recognizes the importance of digital literacy in empowering survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) to access resources and participate in the digital economy. Through its digital literacy workshops, BSM Academy is committed to promoting equity in internet access and usage, particularly for women and girls who are disproportionately affected by GBV. By aligning with areas one and two of the Global Digital Compact, BSM Academy is actively working towards connecting all people to the internet, including schools, and avoiding internet fragmentation. 
 
7 III. RELEVANCE OF BSM PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL DIGITAL COMPACT Submitting an input to the Global Digital Compact is highly relevant to BSM Academy's commitment to promoting digital literacy and ensuring equity in internet access and usage for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV). By participating in the digital compact, BSM Academy has the opportunity to contribute to the development of shared principles for an open, free, and secure digital future for all. The areas of the digital compact: particularly Universal Access and Internet Fragmentation, are directly related to BSM Academy's mission of empowering survivors of GBV through digital literacy. By providing access to digital resources, BSM Academy is helping survivors of GBV overcome barriers to support and resources. BSM Academy's input to the digital compact can help shape the global conversation around digital equity and access, making a meaningful impact on the lives of survivors of GBV. Furthermore, in order to support the digital literacy courses and to gather evidence of the existing inequalities in digital literacy, BSM Academy conducted a survey. The survey aimed to gauge the level of knowledge and skills of the public on the digital economy, particularly among gender-based violence survivors. The results of the survey provide concrete evidence of the need for digital literacy programs and the urgent need to address the digital divide. Through the survey, BSM Academy seeks to contribute to the core principles and key commitments of the Global Digital Compact on Universal Access and Internet Fragmentation.              
 
8  THE METHODOLOGY To collect, consult, and prepare our input, we followed the following process: 1. Designing the survey: We created a qualitative questionnaire about digital citizenship and credible internet information, taking into account the diverse age ranges and global locations of the potential respondents. 2. Distributing the survey: We used various online platforms to distribute the survey and reach a global audience. The survey was open to both male and female participants, with ages ranging from 14 to 64. 3. Collecting responses: We received a total of 61 responses from the survey, which we then analyzed to derive insights and key findings. Of these, 35 respondents were from Europe, representing a significant portion of the sample. The rest comes from the Philippines. 4. Consulting external sources: To ensure the accuracy and relevance of our input, we consulted external sources such as the International Telecommunication Union and the Philippine Statistics Authority to gather additional information about internet access and usage trends in Europe and the Philippines. 5. Analyzing the results: We analyzed the survey results and external sources to identify key themes and insights, which we then used to create our input. 6. Preparing our input: Based on our analysis, we developed our input by creating paragraphs and core principles that highlight the key findings of the survey and external sources. Overall, we followed a rigorous and thorough process to collect, consult, and prepare our input, ensuring that it is based on reliable data and reflects the diverse perspectives and experiences of the survey respondents.     
 
9 AREA 1: CONNECTING ALL PEOPLE TO THE INTERNET, INCLUDING SCHOOLS Connecting all people to the internet is a global challenge, with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) reporting that around half of the world's population still lacks internet access. In the survey conducted, 26 respondents were from the Philippines, where according to the Philippine Statistics Authority, only around 67% of households have access to the internet. The remaining 35 respondents were from Europe, the US, and the Middle East, where internet penetration rates are generally higher. 
 Graph 1: Time being spent online per day The internet usage survey revealed that 55.7% of respondents use the internet for 5-8 hours per day, while 34.4% use it for 8-12 hours per day. This includes the youngest respondent, who was 14 years old, and the oldest, who was 64 years old. Additionally, 9.8% of respondents reported using the internet for more than 12 hours per day, which is a cause for concern (all of whom are based in the Philippines).    

 
10  Regarding digital citizenship, the survey results showed that while a majority of respondents believed that anyone who uses the internet can be considered a digital citizen, 17 out of 60 respondents admitted that they were hearing the term "digital citizenship" for the first time. This highlights the need for greater education and awareness around responsible digital behavior. Overall, these figures underscore the importance of connecting all people to the internet, including all schools. While internet penetration rates are higher in some regions, many individuals still lack access to this essential tool for education, communication, and participation in the digital economy. This digital divide can create inequalities in terms of access to information, educational opportunities, and participation in the digital economy. Those who lack access to the internet can miss out on important resources and knowledge that is increasingly available online. It also exacerbates existing inequalities in society, such as those related to income, race, and geography. For example, individuals from lower-income households may not have the resources to afford internet access or the devices necessary to use it. This can result in a lack of access to online job applications, educational resources, and other important services that can improve their quality of life. Ultimately, not closing the digital gap can lead to a more unequal society, where some individuals have significant advantages in accessing information, education, and opportunities compared to others. It is therefore essential that we take steps to address the digital divide and ensure that everyone has equal access to the benefits of the digital age. In addition, promoting digital citizenship is essential for responsible and safe internet use, especially as online activities continue to become more prevalent in our daily lives. With the majority of survey respondents acknowledging the importance of responsible internet use, it highlights the need for education and awareness programs that promote good digital citizenship.

11 CORE PRINCIPLES FOR DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP & EQUITABLE ACCESS: 1. Universal access: All individuals, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status, should have equal access to the internet and digital resources. This may involve government initiatives to provide internet infrastructure in remote areas or support for low-income households to afford internet access and devices 2. Digital literacy: Education and training should be provided to promote digital literacy skills and responsible online behavior. It is essential for creating a more informed and engaged citizenry. It helps to combat misinformation and disinformation, promotes democratic participation, and supports economic growth and innovation. This includes training on how to use digital technologies effectively, as well as how to evaluate the credibility and reliability of online information. It also includes education on responsible online behavior, such as how to protect personal information, avoid cyberbullying, and engage in respectful and productive online communication. 3. Equity: Efforts should be made to bridge the digital divide and promote equity in internet access and usage. It means ensuring that underserved communities such as rural areas or low-income neighborhoods, have access to high-speed internet and other digital technologies. It also means addressing the cost barriers that may prevent individuals from accessing the internet, such as providing affordable internet plans or subsidizing the cost of internet access for low-income individuals and families. 4. Responsiveness: Policies and practices should be responsive to the evolving nature of technology and its impact on society. It means taking into account the impact of technology on society and adjusting policies and practices accordingly - highly considering its potential risks and benefits. 5. Collaboration: Partnerships and collaboration between government, private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders are crucial to address the complex challenges of promoting digital citizenship and equitable access to the internet. By adhering to these core principles, we can create a more inclusive and equitable digital future, where all individuals have the opportunity to participate in the digital economy, access information and educational resources, and engage in responsible digital behavior.         
 
12  AREA 2: AVOID INTERNET FRAGMENTATION Internet fragmentation can contribute to the spread of misinformation by creating information silos, where individuals are only exposed to a limited range of viewpoints and information. This can occur due to factors such as geographic location, language barriers, and censorship by governments or other entities. When people are only exposed to a limited range of information, they may be more susceptible to believing false information or conspiracy theories that align with their existing beliefs. In addition, the rise of social media and online platforms has made it easier for misinformation to spread quickly and widely. Misinformation can be intentionally spread by bad actors, such as foreign governments or political organizations, in order to manipulate public opinion or sow discord. In some cases, misinformation can be shared unintentionally by individuals who do not realize that the information they are sharing is false. Internet fragmentation can make it more difficult to combat misinformation, as it can be challenging to reach individuals who are in information silos or who are exposed only to certain viewpoints. Additionally, efforts to combat misinformation can be complicated by political or economic interests, as well as by differences in cultural norms and values. The survey presented three options to the respondents, of which they had to identify the credible information. While the majority of respondents were able to correctly identify credible information, there were still some who were unable to distinguish false information from factual information. This highlights the prevalence and potential harm of misinformation in the digital age and underscores the need for greater education and awareness about how to identify and combat misinformation. Although when respondents were asked how they discern real news from propaganda, satire and false information, their primary answer was to consider the source and reference credibility. A reliable news source should be accredited and verified, and it is important to check information on multiple reliable news channels. Cross-referencing and confirming sources is also crucial in determining the accuracy of the news. It is important to be critical of the content with regards to current events and to check for citations or references present within the article. It is also advisable to research the matter and the source from which the news was obtained. Checking the author, reading beyond the headline, and considering the tone of the article are also recommended. If a story is reported by multiple sources, it is more likely to be true. Lastly, fact-checking with other news or reports and ensuring that the source is reliable are important factors in discerning real news from propaganda, satire, and false information. 
 
13  Graph 3: What to do when you see fake news online? However, when they were asked what they do when they see someone posting fake news, 67.2% responded that they will do nothing but continue scrolling, 24.6% will message the user privately to correct them, and 8.2% will comment on the post publicly to call them out. It also appears from the responses that one of the main reasons people post fake news is because of a lack of education and media literacy. Many people do not know how to discern fake news from true information, and they are vulnerable to misinformation. People tend to trust social media outlets, even if the articles they contain are not credible. People also tend to believe what they see without fact-checking or verifying the sources. Moreover, click-bait headlines that tend to exaggerate biases and the lack of active policing from online platforms like Facebook contribute to the spread of fake news. Additionally, people have preconceived biases towards their own beliefs and seek out information that confirms their preexisting beliefs and values. The lack of critical thinking and judgment is also a contributing factor. Based on this, fact-checking becomes a crucial part of the digital economy as it helps to maintain the integrity and accuracy of information online. With the increasing dependence on digital platforms for information, misinformation and fake news can have significant economic consequences. Moreover, the spread of fake news can create uncertainty and panic in the markets, leading to fluctuations in stock prices and economic instability. Fact-checking helps to mitigate these risks by providing accurate information and preventing the spread of false information that can harm individuals, businesses, and the economy as a whole. Overall, fact-checking promotes digital literacy and helps people distinguish between fake news and true information. When people can identify credible sources and fact-check information, they are less likely to be misled and more likely to make informed decisions. In turn, this helps to build trust in the digital economy and promote a healthy information environment.  

 
14 CORE PRINCIPLES TO AVOID INTERNET FRAGMENTATION: 1. Promote digital literacy: Educate people on how to distinguish between credible and false sources of information, how to fact-check, and how to critically evaluate the information they encounter online. 2. Encourage diversity of opinions: Encourage people to seek out different perspectives and engage in respectful dialogue with those who hold different views. This can help to break down echo chambers and prevent people from becoming trapped in their own filter bubbles. 3. Foster a culture of fact-checking: Promote fact-checking as a social norm and encourage people to question the veracity of information they encounter online. This can help to prevent the spread of false information and promote the dissemination of accurate, reliable information. 4. Ensure transparency: Encourage platforms to be transparent about how their algorithms work, how they moderate content, and how they handle user data. This can help to build trust in online platforms and prevent people from feeling like they are being manipulated or deceived. 5. Empower users: Give users the tools and resources they need to take control of their online experience. This could include providing users with more control over their data, giving them the ability to customize their news feed, or providing them with the ability to report false information. By promoting these core principles, we can help to create a more informed, connected, and collaborative online community, and prevent the fragmentation of the internet.
