April 30, 2023| India  
I. Introduction  
The Council for Social and Digital Development  (CSDD) , the Digital Empowerment 
Foundation  (DEF) , the North East Development Foundation  (NEDF),  and the Royal 
Global University  (RGU) , Assam, and the eNorth East Digital Alliance, is pleased to 
submit inputs to the Global Digital Compact (GDC). The inputs are based on a 
stakeholder’s discussion from the North East Region of India in South Asia (comp rising  
of 8 States covering the North East India Himalayan States), through online  mode  
(Zoom meeting) on April 28, 2023.  The d iscussion  was on the state of connectivity and 
the social aspect to digital access and technological advancements  with a focus on 
north east Indian states, the geographical spread of which greatly overlaps with the 
eastern Himalayan region . 
II. Description of entity/organization  
The Council for Social and Digital Development (CSDD) is a research and policy 
advocacy organ ization working at the intersection of technology and society. Based out 
of Guwahati, Assam in the north east region of India, the council works towards 
evidence building, creating narratives, building  narratives on emerging digital and 
society related iss ues in the particular context of North  East India , a predominantly tribal 
region.  
 
 

III. KEY AREAS / CORE PRINCIPLES / KEY COMMITMENTS  
 
1. Connect all people to the Internet, including all schools  
 
Core Principles   
 
 Structured, systematic and process -oriented Internet Access:  The COVID -19 
pandemic hastened the adoption of internet for all including amongst the school -
going children.  There  needs to be a structure way the internet is adopted  in schools 
and by the young learners as well as the educators / teacher s. There should be 
sensitisation of the teachers and instructors to help guide the young, impressionable 
children on what the internet can offer.  
 Need and Capacity Oriented Access:  Internet is one of the great levelers in 
helping bridge the information gap . But there needs to be evaluation of needs of an 
institute when providing internet. What are they going to deliver to the students? 
Where are they going to create? Where are they going to store what they create?  
 Content as Core:  Initiatives in the educat ion and other sector with regards to 
internet is without any content management. In the absence of quality content 
delivery, incongruence between demand and delivery of content, asymmetry 
between the  subject and course delivery , then mere connectivity is f ruitless.  
Education and specific content delivery digitally must have content charter that 
outlines and provides guidance on what, how, when to deliver content to consumers 
and learners in schools.  
 Asymmetric connectivity : The geographical and topographical internet and access 
divides can be addressed with heavy focus on robust satellite connectivity for the 
inaccessible regions as the traditional modes of mobile phone tower and fiber cable 
connectivity face additional chall enges of maintenance in the regions due to the 
geographic terrain. There is need to e xplore alternative networks and portable 
networks to help connect people living in difficult terrains with bad network 
connectivity.  
 ‘Integrated Connectivity’ : Besides rur al and remote geographies, e ven in semi 
urban areas connectivity is a big challenge , and rural connectivity has a long way to 
go. It is not internet alone but all the supporting infrastructure of regular electricity 
supply, last mile networks, access to de vices needs to work in congruence as an 
integrated toolkit.    
 Satellite Connectivity as a key priority:  Cost of accessing internet connectivity will 
come down in the next few years with the proliferation of satellite connectivity. But 
reliance on physical  infrastructure like towers, fiber is going to be counterproductive.  
 Meaningful connectivity and affordable connectivity : should be guiding factors to 
make ‘Internet for all’ a real possibility. This has larger inclusive and sustainability 
significance.  
 Internet and digital training  must be a core component in connectivity and access 
for all. Training of the trainers or of teachers and instructors to efficiently guide 
students to build competencies and make meaningful use of internet.  The 
generational inte rnet and digital gaps need  emphasis on internet and digital skills 
training.  
 The ‘Quality of bandwidth ’ determines ‘Quality of Life’:  Quality of bandwidth 
being delivered to people and classrooms needs to be analysed and optimised to be 
truly useful inste ad of focusing  only on connecting to the internet.  
 ‘Public Internet Access’:  Policies and programmes must be designed and 
sustained for m ore public open spaces with open  and free  Wifi connectivity. Low 
cost public Wifi zones should be intensified.   The millions of unconnected people 
need special arrangements like Community Internet Libraries (CILs) to mainstream 
people in remote community.  Efforts like this can stop incidences of Net micro-
migration in villages where people are migrating to areas w here they can get access 
to internet connectivity during times of examinations , as was evident in the peak of 
the pandemics.  
Key Commitments from Stakeholders  
 Infrastructure investment:  To guarantee that everyone has access to the internet, 
governments sh ould invest in developing the required infrastructure, such as 
broadband networks. Public -private partnerships or initiatives supported by the 
government can be used to accomplish this.  
 
 Promoting digital literacy:  To make sure that everyone has the skills and 
information required to use the internet efficiently and safely, civil society 
organisations, governments, and businesses should encourage digital literacy 
programmes.  
 Accessibility:  Businesses and governments  should endeavour to ensure that 
everyone has inexpensive access to the internet, especially those who live in rural or 
low-income areas.  
 Ensuring user privacy and security:  When connecting consumers to the internet, 
governments and businesses should prior itise their privacy and security. This can be 
accomplished by rules, guidelines, and instruction on safe internet usage.  
 Fostering innovation:  To broaden access to the internet and enhance its 
capabilities, businesses and governments should support innovat ion and the 
creation of new technologies.  
 Collaboration with stakeholders:  To accomplish the aim of universal internet 
access, all stakeholders —including schools —should cooperate and work together. 
Partnerships between governments, businesses, and groups f rom civil society are 
examples of this, as well as interactions with nearby communities and educational 
institutions to learn about their wants and requirements.

management, and governance of digital commons. Governments, companies, and 
other stakeholders should commit to providing users with the tools, resources, and 
support they need to participate in digital commons.
