0 Introduction  
The Global Digital Compact (GDC) - Asia Consultations took place on March 21st and 22nd, 2023 in New 
Delhi, India. Similar consultations have t aken place earlier for Africa (in Kenya, December 2022) and The 
Americas (in Mexico, February 2023). These consultations will lead to the Ministerial Meeting on the 
Summit of the Future (September 2023) and Summit of the Future - Global Digital Compact (Se ptember 
2024). Participants for GDC Asia Consultations included stakeholders from government, civil society, 
private sector, academia, and international organizations, and had the following objectives:  
• Contribute to the exchange of ideas about the potentia l as well as the challenges in the future use 
of digital technologies.   
• Develop actionable inputs regarding digital inclusion to be included in the framework of the 
Global Digital Compact.   
• Create a shared vision of the challenges and priorities of Asia re garding digital transformation.  
 
 
 
1 Executive Summary : Main Findings and Outcomes  
The two -day-workshop was preceded by a preparation call for participants on March 17th, 2023, clarifying 
its context, its objectives and its agenda as well as the participants’ expectations and questions. The 
workshop itself took place with approximately 50 participants from governmental institutions, the private 
sector, non -governmental or ganizations as well as academia and research. At the core of the workshop were 
eight thematic sessions (sessions a - h), during which participants discussed and wrote down their input 
based on guiding questions. The main results of these exchanges are summ arized in the following segments.  
Work Session (a): Role of Digital Public Goods (DPGs) and Digital Public Infrastructures (DPIs) in the 
GDC to achieve the 2030 SDG Agenda:  
 
• Emerging tech/digital applications for contemporary challenges:  
Emerging tech and digital applications already help - and can help more - in many ways, such as 
access to healthcare and finance for the underserved, vaccine delivery with drones, blockchain for 
credit score calculation, AI for agricultural product management, energy optimi zation, and carbon 
tracking (sustainability).  
Emerging technologies are customized for special needs, but such ad -hoc applications have 
limitations. Thus, foundational challenges of infrastructure, literacy, and affordability must be 
addressed for a bottom -up approach. Further, silos amongst and within governments must be 
addressed to have interoperable data and data standards. Fully representative data must be used as 
a shared resource (data commons) for contemporary challenges. GDC can play an enabling ro le in 
providing the digital common infrastructure such as data, data policy frameworks, and data 
exchange platforms.  
• Role of GDC in sharing of DPIs and DPGs among member states:  
GDC could facilitate and/or provide knowledge management services, capacity bu ilding, a 
network of expertise, and funding. Further, local needs must be understood – local capacity could 
be built with the participation of universities and civil society.  
GDC could also promote and set standards for open, inclusive, and safe DPIs. The interoperability 
and scalability of DPIs must ensure ‘privacy by design’ and avoid vendor lock -ins. GDC could 
develop principles for the governance of DPIs towards fairness, and equity and disallowing new 
kinds of rent -seeking. It can also support the repl ication of DPI/DPGs between countries.  
• DPIs’ promotion of innovation by the private sector:  
New products can be set up with a fraction of the costs (automation saves cost). Education for the 
youth is critical for the best usage of technology for innovatio n. Creating a good business model 
could encourage the private sector to participate in the DPI ecosystem. Having DPIs as a digital 
backbone will facilitate increased private sector contribution for innovation.  
• Level of contribution expected from stakeholde rs:  
The design of DGP/DPI should be rights -based, transparent by design, localizable, open to 
assessment by independent actors.   
• Funding for the development of a DPI ecosystem:  
DPI solutions must ideally have self -sustainable business solutions (with good revenue models 
and lessons from traditional project finance mechanisms) to avoid continuous reliance on 
grants/public funding. Funding must be democratic when provided – quadratic funding may be 
explored.  
 
Dedicated funding and regional coordination fa cilities must be created. Funding must be 
consultative with the public, especially the most structurally vulnerable groups. The usage of 
public funding must be transparent, accountable, and open to critique and oversight.  
• DPIs/digital technologies for the development of low -and-middle -income (LMI) countries:   
DPIs can enable scalability and capacity -building requirements of LMI governments, co -
operatives, and civil society organizations, and last -mile service delivery. However, DPIs must 
understand local ne eds and values including that of structurally silenced groups – women, 
oppressed classes, disabled. Digital solutions for LMICs may need global cooperation and thus 
cannot be restricted to LMIC contexts.    
  
Work Session (b): Ensuring inclusive, open, accessible, safe, and affordable digital technologies and 
infrastructure  
• Role of stakeholders:   
Government must provide a level playing field to private actors, address areas of market failure, 
improve competition of each part of the digital connectivity v alue chain (avoiding monopoly), 
streamline access to the right of way and public sector connectivity infrastructure, track and 
punish exploitation enabled by tech (child abuse, etc.). However, the government's role may need 
to be reimagined due to its pate rnalizing factors. The private sector must view community 
networks as partners for creating new markets (instead of competition/threat) and invest in local 
content and platforms. Stakeholders must focus on human -centricity and inclusivity – especially 
the youth.  
 
• Necessary short -term measures with the role of GDC:   
For existing DPIs, countries must implement/strengthen governance mechanisms where missing 
and/or deficient. For upcoming DPIs, establish governance mechanisms, advisory and safety 
panels before systems go live. Trade -offs need to be managed – safety v/s affordability; 
accessibility v/s safety. GDC may provide engaging and educative frameworks or modules for 
awareness and additionally provide consultations on changing and emerging technology.  
 
• Capacity constraints and solutions:  
Education for technologists (engineers, designers) is not holistic – education with a broader 
worldview will enhance inclusivity. Low literacy affects accessibility – the design could be on 
speech or visual images. Present ly, technology and internet applications are impliedly market -
centprofit -centrictric – affordability needs to increase. There is a lack of programming knowledge 
on developing for people with disabilities that  should be addressed.  
 
Work Session c): Co -gover nance model for developing Global Digital Cooperation:  
• Suitable models :  
Existing mechanisms within ITU/ICANN/G20/WEF could be strengthened with structural support 
by GDC to regional areas. The mechanism must be flexible but not changeable – a third -party 
body may oversee the system. Individual governments’ feedback is necessary. Public authorities 
must not be upended from their legitimate governance role – Big Tech is getting too much of a 
governance role while it needs governance itself. Benef iciaries should also be able to vote on the 
technology and its features thereby  increasing participation in the governance for developing 
digital cooperation.  
• Role of GDC:   
 
Define standards on what is a safe, accessible, trustworthy internet for stakeholders; and develop a 
framework and procedures for cross -border data flow for legitimate needs.  
• Elements needing common regulation/standards:   
Climate action; creating global talent pool; cross border labor mobility; e -commerce; cross border 
data flow; technical standards on accessibility and language.  
 
Work Session (d):  Inclusion and gender equality in global digital transformation  
• Ensuring inclusive participation:   
Understand gender beyond the traditional binary and ensure participation of most m arginalized 
and intersectional vulnerable groups in consultative and decision -making processes. Potential 
barriers to participation must be addressed – limited access to tech, limited digital literacy, and 
barriers of language, behaviur, culture, and socia l barriers. Address digital literacy by focusing on 
school curriculum including sexual and reproductive health rights as well as ensuring affordable 
digital devices and involve the private sector for awareness creation and upskilling.   
• Bridging the digital  gender divide and addressing gender -based online violence:   
Adopt an intersectional gender approach to access and application of human rights online with 
special attention to online gender -based violence and gendered disinformation. Human -centric 
cybersecurity approaches could address online violence.   AI models can be used to moderate 
online public forums and targeted programs to include women and girls in the development of 
emerging technologies. More specifically, AI models can red uce biases and stereotyping.  
 
Work Session (e): Impact of AI/ML and emerging technologies on online/offline privacy and protection  
• Risks:   
Biases in AI/ML systems risk marginalization of certain sections - inherent human biases enter 
AI/ML systems and data  sets are not crafted to address bias. Bias is related to exclusion and 
distributional issues – who gains or not (beneficiaries of tech -based welfare), who owns and 
controls, who just consume. Privacy, limited access, copyright, and algorithmic black box a re 
other risks. The existing gap in access to AI/ML by developing countries poses a risk, as well.  
• Usage of emerging tech:   
Cross usage of tech in designing risk management. For example, while AI is known for exclusion 
risks, blockchain can embed trust, transparency, and accountability. Online content’s pattern 
analysis by AI fights mis -/disinformation.  
• Role of GDC in ensuring safeguards:   
GDC could gather best practices of AI use, harm, and benefits and harmonize existing and 
emerging regulations, standards, and guidelines.  
  
Work Session (f):  Building the capacity gap for developing countries in emerging technologies  
• Funding, policies, and infrastructure development:   
The focus must be on R&D and creating an ecosystem between industry, academia, and 
government. Publicly funded research must be made open source and must be made available 
 
through global rese arch networks. Academia must incentivize policy -relevant output, teach 
interdisciplinary courses (law and tech), utilize its reach to the youth, and support the 
marginalized. Global scholarships will incentivize researchers in underdeveloped/developing 
countries.  
• Incentivize local innovation and entrepreneurship:   
Streamline registration of startups, give tax incentives, share data pools for access, and provide 
opportunities in local projects. However, a culture of innovation must be embedded in education 
for long -term incentivization.    
  
Work Session (g) : Security by design: scalable and affordable technologies:  
• Open and accessible technologies must be broadly defined but should not take away the agency 
from private parties for innovation and ca pability building. Further, open technologies need to be 
sustained with continuous contributions from those who have the capacity to adopt them locally.  
 
• The present concerns of cybersecurity on digital technologies are for example: security and safety 
standards, fraud, fake news, cyberbullying, identity theft, and a lack of regulatory governance on 
cross -border tech companies.  
 
• GDC can contribute to basic security and safety by furthering collaboration between sectors and  
developing high -level guidelines a nd principles with respect to human rights.  
 
Work Session (h) : Capacity building for developing countries in cyber security:  
• Increase awareness by imparting digital literacy skills and developing training courses by expert 
volunteers. Further, the needs of  all stakeholders must be understood – government, technical 
professionals, and general consumers. Simultaneously, jobs in governments and companies may 
be created to stimulate relevant demand. Universal implementation of cybersecurity could need 
enforceab le treaties and conventions.  
 
• Agreements, standards or treaties on cross -border cyber attacks  and security can significantly 
contribute to the universal implementation of cybersecurity.

for the Global Digital Compact collaboration across different stakeholders, including governments, 
civil so ciety, the private sector, academia, and the tech community, to imagine a digital future together. 
Mr. Gill highlights that the process is currently focused on listening and gathering inputs through the 
three regional consultations – Africa, America, and A sia – that are held in cooperation with the 
governments of Kenya, Mexico, and India. The Secretary -General will present a policy brief to the 
Member States and other stakeholders by the end of April, which will be reflected in an issue paper 
presented to m inisters in September.  
Mr. Gill emphasizes that the Global Digital Compact is one of several crucial outcomes that will be 
adopted at the Summit of the Future in 2024, which follows the SDGs summit, addressing the digital 
divide in all its aspects to accelerate progress on sustainable development.  
He also highlights the importance of a shared vision to guide our actions, which can align the actions 
of different stakeholders across borders, but also across domains. The Tech Envoy stresses the 
significan ce of the regional consultations and inputs that reflect the particular regional context and 
the importance of said shared vision, if we are to accelerate progress on sustainable development and 
address the digital, connectivity and content divide as well as improve access to infrastructure and 
the security of our data. Addressing the participants, Mr. Gill points out the importance of the diverse 
group of participants that are present and their input to the discussions.  
1.2 Abhishek Singh, CEO, National e -Governance Division, Ministry of Electronics 
and Information Technology India  
Mr. Abhishek Singh discusses India's digital strategy, which has focused on leveraging technology to 
empower people and enable access to services focusing on how the use of digital technology has been 
critical in ensuring that people have access to safe services, even during the COVID -19 pandemic. 
India's digital strategy has focused on creating digital public goods and infrastructure. Further, the 
digital identity project, digital payments, and e -learning platforms are some of the initiatives also 
undertaken in the country. He reiterates that digital technologies have enabled access to services, 
inclusion, and empowerment of people at the grassroots  levels in India.  
Mr. Singh also emphasizes the importance of learning from other countries and collaborating to create 
digital public goods and infrastructure that work across borders. He mentions the creation of a 
common portal called "IndiaStack at Glob al" to showcase digital products and codes that are open -
source and notes that India's digital efforts have been led not just by the government but also by the 
private and non -profit sector as well as entrepreneurs.  
The CEO also highlighted that finding te chnical solutions - especially Digital Public Goods - is a 
journey of partnership and of working together and he hopes that the work will be continued in the 
same spirit driven by the United Nations and other global bodies and ensure that India becomes par t 
of the consortium which helps in the adaptation on the digital public goods.  
 
 
 7 1.3 Dr. Philipp Ackermann, German Ambassad or to India  
Dr. Philipp Ackermann, German Ambassador to India, expresses gratitude to the Indian Ministry of 
External Affairs and the Joint  Secretariat for their partnership in the Asia Consultations on the Global 
Digital Compact and highlights the commitment of the Indian and German governments to contribute 
to the GDC process with the aim of leveraging the full potential of digitization for  achieving the 2030 
agenda. He emphasizes that the Indian government shows leadership in the region by transferring 
shared principles of democracy and the rule of law into the digital world. Dr. Ackermann reiterates 
that the aims of the GDC are, to bring s takeholders together and to establish shared principles for an 
open, free, inclusive, and secure digital future, based on the principles of inclusiveness and 
transparency.  
He acknowledges the challenge of regulating the internet and the importance of devel oping guidelines 
to prevent harmful misuse of technology. He then points out the harm that can be caused by 
misinformation and cyber attacks and therefore the significance to develop a set of guidelines that 
prevents harmful misuse of technology.   
Dr. Acke rmann proceeds to address the participants in the room, stating the importance that so many 
highly qualified experts from different stakeholders and  various fields of expertise discuss in the 
coming days and a half about these very important matters. The A mbassador hopes that the 
participants will provide significant recommendations on multiple topics of the future GDC and 
emphasizes the importance of discussing these matters in person to have significant recommendations 
from the Asia Consultation for the G lobal Digital Compact.  
 
1.4 Muan puii Saiawi, Joint Secretary, Cyber Diplomacy, Ministry of External Affairs 
India  
The Joint Secretary, Cyber Diplomacy, Ministry of External Affairs India, Ms. Muanpuii Saiawi 
welcomes the delegates to the Asian regional consult ations to contribute to the United Nations Global 
Digital Compact, which is a framework for stakeholders to come together and work towards a more 
inclusive, equitable, responsible, and sustainable digital future. Ms. Saiawi notes that we are living in 
an age that is driven by technology, and the use of digital technologies in our daily lives has increased 
exponentially since the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic. She points out that the increased use of 
digital technologies has also created new forms of inequa lity, exacerbated existing ones, and raised 
important questions about privacy, security, and the protection of human rights.  
She highlights that the GDC aims to ensure that digital technologies are used in responsible ways that 
promote economic, social, an d cultural development, and aligns with the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals. The Joint Secretary focuses on key areas of action which include ensuring 
universal access to digital technologies, protecting personal data and privacy, promoting digital 
inclus ion and literacy, and fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.  
She points out that the agenda for the New Delhi consultations will focus on how the GDC and SDG 
2030 can be set and implemented to the fullest potential and will address challenges such as t he digital 
divide and ensure that the benefits are shared by all. Further, she hopes that the gathering will serve 
as a catalyst for further action toward a more sustainable and equitable digital future.  
 
 
 8 1.5 Dr. Regine Grienberger, Cyber Ambassador, Federal Foreign Of fice Germany  
The German Cyber Ambassador, Dr. Regine Grienberger, is participating in the third round of 
consultations with Amandeep Singh Gill to prepare the ground for the Global Digital Compact. The 
ambassador believes that the Global Digital Compact helps in reaching the Sustainable Development 
Goals, especially digitization will be one of the essential tools to reach the SDGs. The Ambassador 
also emphasizes the importance of inclusivity in the process of shaping the digital age and in vites all 
stakeholders, including civil society, private sector, academia, and technical communities, to share 
their perspectives.  
Dr. Grienberger encourages the participants to share personal experiences and approaches on the topic 
with the other particip ants because this will make the consultations very rich in detail and in the 
perspectives that are shared and filter into the GDC. She points out the risks of the Internet – these 
days because of misinformation and disinformation, cybercrime, and scams – but encourages 
participants to also focus on the positive sides of the Internet: We can learn from global communities 
in a way that was not possible before the Internet was invented. Secondly, the Ambassador 
emphasized that, even though governments will sig n the GDC, governments will not be able to shape 
the digital age as it is necessary. Therefore, all stakeholders - civil society, private sector, academia, 
and also the technical communities – are important and also present here in this consultation and ar e 
invited to share their perspectives, which will make the GDC become relevant in the end. Lastly, she 
highlights the necessity of cross -regional cooperation in shaping the Global Digital Compact as 
regional perspectives are highly significant to this glob al compact. Therefore, the consultation should 
focus on joint issues and common denominators for example digital commons, where India already 
is a champion, and the application of AI.  
Dr. Grienberger highlights the interest in cross -regional cooperation in  shaping the Global Digital 
Compact and encourages the discussion of joint issues and regional specificities. She points out that 
the consultations provide a valuable opportunity for a rich discussion on joint issues and regional 
specificities.  
1.6 Ambassador Anna -Karin Eneström, Permanent Representative of  Sweden to the 
UN 
The Permanent Representative of Sweden to the United Nations, Ambassador Anna Karin Eneström, 
expresses gratitude towards the organizers and participants and shares about the process of lead ing 
the intergovernmental negotiations for the Global Digital Compact together with the Permanent 
Representative of Rwanda to the UN. The Ambassador states, that the GDC is a critical step towards 
enhancing global digital cooperation and achieving the Sust ainable Development Goals. The 
consultations – including the regional consultations – conducted so far have been constructive and 
valuable, bringing in a wide variety of issues, including how digital tools can be used to boost the 
implementation of the 203 0 Agenda and how to bridge the gender digital divide.  
She encourages participation in the upcoming deep dives to be held from March to June by the co -
facilitators Sweden and Rwanda. She further explains that an issue paper will be prepared after the 
deep d ives and will be consulted with Member States in New York, feeding into the ministerial 
meeting in September.  
Ambassador Eneström identifies eight areas that could serve as building blocks for the Global Digital 
Compact that are also reflected in the agend a for the Asia Consultation: digital inclusion and 
connectivity; internet governance; data protection; human rights online; digital trust and security; 
 
 
 9 artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies; global digital commons, and accelerating 
progre ss on Sustainable Development Goals.  
The Ambassador emphasizes the importance of the regional consultations and their opportunity for 
all stakeholders to develop and shape a shared vision of digital cooperation. She states that the process 
is at a very ear ly stage of the consultations and from the start the emphasis is on inclusivity, 
transparency, and meaningfulness. The Ambassador is happy to listen to the voices of the participants 
over the coming days and learn how they see challenges and opportunities in the digital 
transformation in Asia.  
 
 
 
 10 2. Workshop, Session, and Report M ethodology  
The workshop was the last of the three regional consultations. Like the two previous consultations, it 
aimed at acquiring opinions, inputs, and key messages to bring into the ‘Summit of the Future’ 
process. To do so, approximately 50 expert participants from various Asian countries were invited.   
The Tw o-day workshop was preceded by a virtual preparation call for participants on 17 March 2023, 
clarifying its context, objectives, agenda, as well as the participants’ expectations and questions. From 
this day on, participants could also access a Miro board,  a digital whiteboard, and real -time online 
collaboration tool, to access all necessary resources for the workshop: Recommended readings on the 
workshop’s topics, agenda, guiding questions for the different sessions, information on speakers and 
the GDC pro cess. It also allowed participants to briefly present themselves and exchange contacts to 
stay in touch beyond the workshop.  
The workshop itself was opened by the above -mentioned welcoming remarks, followed by an 
exercise to discover who is in the room and  participates in the exchanges. As a result, it became clear 
that a balanced representation of governmental institutions, the private sector, non -governmental 
organizations, as well as academia and research, was assured. It also delivered transparency abou t 
which precise organizations were represented. In terms of participating age groups, about half of the 
participants were between 31 and 45 years old. Roughly one quarter of the participants also 
represented the group of 18 - 30 years and another quarter t he group of 46 - 60 years. Only one 
participant was older than 60 years.  
At the core of the workshop were 8 thematic sessions (sessions a - h), during which participants 
discussed and wrote down their input based on guiding questions. The guiding questions  were not 
binding and participants could also address aspects not covered by those questions. Participants were 
also encouraged to focus on those questions to which they could contribute most or which were the 
most relevant ones for them. Each of the 8 the matic sessions was structured in a similar way based 
on the following sequencing:  
a) A short moment to reflect on the guiding questions by themselves (alone)  
b) A few minutes to exchange questions with a neighbor at the table (group of 2)  
c) A few minutes to exchange with another group of 2, sitting at the same table (group of 4). At 
this point, participants were encouraged to write down the ‘table -ideas’ on the digital Miro 
board.  
d) Between half and three -quarters of the session time was then dedicated to a mod erated 
exchange in plenary, based on the discussions already started at the tables. Participants were 
asked to remain concise to allow a maximum of contributions.  
New aspects that were brought up during the plenary were written down on the Miro board by tw o 
notetakers. Participants followed the notetaking of everyone on their own laptop and smartphone 
devices, as well as on the big conference screens provided by the venue so that there has been 
transparency about which aspects were written down and how they  were formulated at any given 
time. The participants were also encouraged to underline or reinforce a statement on the Miro board 
by adding an exclamation mark icon to the note in question. They were equally encouraged to display 
their dissent regarding a taken note by adding a lightning icon to it.  
After each session, the respective part of the Miro board was locked, so no further modifications 
could be made by any participants. There was, however, the possibility to add comments to the 
existing notes unti l the end of the event.  
 
 
 11 This report, including the final recommendations to the GDC, has been developed based on those 
contributions noted on the Miro board. Responsible for the first report draft were five ‘Report 
Champions’ who consisted mainly of worksh op participants. This draft was then opened to be 
reviewed and approved by all workshop participants. In the following chapters, the detailed results 
from each thematic session, as well as condensed key messages per session, are displayed.  
 
 
 
 12 3. Work Session (a):  Role of Digital Public Goods (DPG) including Digital 
Public Infrastructure (DPI) in the GDC to achieve the 2030 Agenda  
3.1 How can emerging technologies and digital applications be used to address 
contemporary challenges?  
A few important contemporary areas where emerging technology can help address challenges that 
the participants identified in their discussions, included Climate Change, Access to Healthcare and 
Finance, Agriculture, Education, and Social Welfare and Protection schemes. In addition, the role of 
emerging tech in decreasing corruption by weaving in trust transparency, and accountability was 
also stressed. The group used a broad definition of emerging technologies ranging from drones, A I, 
open data, and digital public goods and infrastructures each of which played crucial roles in the 
overall ability to respond to challenges. To do so emerging technologies needed to be thought of as 
supplementing but not substituting human capacities and  resources when dealing with 
contemporary challenges.  
The group also stressed on the need to adopt holistic and proactive approaches to emerging 
technologies and digital applications. While recognizing that currently emerging technologies are 
often used in  an ad hoc manner to respond to a crisis, this mode of operating leads to solutions not 
being built bottom -up and taking into consideration all ecosystem actors. This meant that the 
potential of emerging technologies that lend themselves to customization t o special needs and 
contexts was not harnessed effectively.  
The group highlighted the importance of bringing in a level playing field by expanding access to 
emerging technologies to a wide swathe of the population across different contexts and realities. 
While emerging technologies can help elevate and bring people to the same strata to do so it is 
important to have more representative data from all quarters of society – especially children in 
developing countries. Such proactive and holistic approaches sho uld acknowledge and respond to 
the gender gap, the accessibility gap, the urban -rural gap, the language gap, and structural issues of 
casteism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, classism, and xenophobia which can easily be 
magnified in an online world. A p roactive approach would also need to overcome the foundational 
challenges of infrastructure, literacy, and affordability.  
The participants identified the importance of stakeholder engagement and consultation at the right 
levels to enable a bottoms -up appro ach to addressing these challenges and coming up with solutions 
that can be personalized and/or adaptable to different contexts.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Emerging technologies lend themselves to customization to special needs  and contexts, 
however, we need to overcome the foundational challenges of infrastructure, literacy, and 
affordability.  
• Transparency and accountability in governance: for instance, fruitful stakeholder 
discussions on draft laws are needed.  
Disabilities and  accessibilities  
Employment and Equal opportunity  
• Institute interoperability laws so that DPIs get actually used, and not just Bit -Tech provided 
infra.  
 
 
 13 • Emerging technologies are often used in an ad hoc manner to respond to a crisis, not 
building bottom up,  taking into consideration all ecosystem actors.  
• Affordable  
• Supplement but not substitute human capacities and resources  
Open data used for research in resolving climate change issues, measuring SDG indicators  
Open source  technologies to develop tools used in government and by the public  
• Bring in the level playing field by expanding access to a wide set of the population from 
diff contexts and realities; emerging tech can help elevate and bring people to the same state  
• to have more representative data from all quarters of society, especially children in 
developing countries - additionally, Emerging Tech must adhere to principles of data (Data 
commons)  
• What are the contemporary challenges?  
• Access to healthcare, and finance to  those in remote areas: Drones used during Covid for 
vaccine delivery, AI test management rules for calculating agricultural product damage, 
blockchain used for calculating credit score regarding loan repayment by Self Help Groups.  
• Personalised /adaptable solutions  
• Reduce silos within governmental platforms  
• to address the problem of scale and   provide service delivery in public health, education, 
and social protection schemes  
• Emerging Tech can help decrease corruption which is a rampant problem f or the region by 
weaving in trust and transparency and accountability  
• to address the problem of scale and   provide service delivery in public health, education, 
and social protection schemes  
• to break silos and to have interoperable data -data standards (dat a commons - data as a 
shared resource, as a DPG)  
• important to acknowledge and respond to the gender gap, the accessibility gap, the urban -
rural gap, the language gap, and structural issues of casteism, ableism, homophobia, 
transphobia, classism, and xenoph obia which easily go online  
• Emerging Technologies can be used in the climate crisis. Energy optimization and tracking 
carbon. It is means to an end using a bottom -up approach. Need to identify at which stage 
should the stakeholders be involved.  
3.2 How can the  GDC facilitate sharing of Digital Public Infrastructure and/or Digital 
Public Goods among Member States?  
The participants felt that on some topics the GDC process could play a facilitative role including:  
• Helping countries save costs  and time and accelerate their efforts by making commonly 
needed digital public goods discoverable  
• Enabling capacity building among civil servants and public officials by providing them 
with access to technical expertise, procurement guidance, and driving cross -country sharing 
of experiences using the UN system.  
• Facilitating the setting and adoption of principles and standards for DPGs and DPIs that 
govern their creation and use, while safeguarding against new forms of rent -seeking within 
and between countries.  
• Identifyi ng DPIs that need to be developed at a global level and the institutional support 
needed to create these.  
•  Supporting the creation of appropriate funding pools and mechanisms to support the 
implementation of DPGs/DPIs. Such funding must be for the full lif ecycle of DPI projects – 
and go beyond mere implementation.  
 
 
 14 Participants also felt that in some areas the GDC could have requirements that countries commit to the 
meeting including:  
• Requiring relevant open data sets to be made available by governments as well as private 
companies that have received public investment at any point. These could also include data 
generated/held in DPIs . 
•  Requiring countries to make in principle commitment s to open source and maintain SDG -
relevant systems such as DPG/DPI.  
• Putting in place the needed checks and balances – including relevant national/international 
institutional regimes – to prevent the abuse/misuse of DPG and DPI by member states. 
These shoul d ensure the protection of end users.  
• Addressing IP/ Proprietary issues through legal/regulatory mechanisms - so that 
stakeholders have assurance about their contribution to DPIs.  
  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• GDC should facilitate and reach some sense of agreement on what kind of Digital 
Infrastructure will constitute Digital Public Infrastructure.  
• Cost saving, Time, Acceleration, best practice common platform with open source:   
• Digital Identity, Payment Gateway,  Mechanis m to provide cheap/affordable computers, 
Online Public Service Template, Capacity Building.  
• holding government and private companies (that at any point received public investment - 
e.g. telecom) to account for their data being open and accessible.  
• GDC shou ld facilitate the discussion on what kind of Global DPI can be developed at a 
global level and what level of institutional support is needed to move in that direction? 
(using the commons approach).  
• GDC ensures continuous capacity building among civil serva nts/public officials who are 
implementing the GDC in the country.  
• GDC should help build capacity for DPG development (DPGA is facing challenges)  
• Promoting and setting standards for DPIs - open, safe, inclusive DPIs. Promoting Open 
Standards and Open Source ; Interoperability; scaleability and modular systems; privacy by 
design, avoiding vendor lock -in, etc.  
• GDC could act as a knowledge management   service (to avoid duplication) including 
capacity building and providing a network of expertise.  
• Increase the co mmunity around DPGs to meet demand from member states  
• Procurement guidance to member states to be able to work with DPGs, access technical 
expertise from outside the country/region.  
• Ensuring that the data in the DPIs are open, with the ability to mine and meaning -making 
algorithms as private sources of competitive advantage.  
• GDC includes a list of open data sets that should be made available by the governments.  
• Support South -South Cooperation in sharing DPI/DPG experience, including using 
capacities and net works of the UN system.  
• In principle commitments to open source and maintain SDG -relevant systems such as 
DPG/DPI.  
• Avoid redundancy, build interoperability and democratic values: Using the mass -scale 
deployment of successful DPIs to build knowledge and des ign standards through a bottom -
p approach that allows inclusivity accessibility and interoperability.  
 
 
 15 • GDC can help in standard setting - with lessons from vendor lock -ins. 
• Replication of success between states/countries.  
• Reconfiguration for replication will need appropriate funding.  
• Hold member states accountable to open data.  
• Need to make sure that DPI and DPG and the tech behind it are not abused/misused by 
member states themselves for eg. when conservative anti -rights regimes come to power  - 
how to make sure that this does not get 'shared' as it has happened before.  
• (Institutional regime at intergovernmental level keep checks and balance and guardrails)  
• Develop principles for governance of DPIs towards fairness and equity, and disallowing 
new kinds of rent -seeking, and using code/ architecture as law in an illegitimate manner not 
subject to democratic processes.  
• Building beyond the right DPI instead of replicating. Cooperation and corroboration 
between member states.  
• IP/ Proprietary issues n eed to be addressed through legal/regulatory mechanisms - so that 
stakeholders have assurance about their contribution to DPIs.  
• Funding must be for full lifecycle of DPI projects - beyond implementation. Should also 
factor in re -imagination, reconfiguratio n, and learning. Focus on design stage as well 
instead of just building.  
• Actioning DPI interoperability by building local capacity with participation of universities, 
civil society.  
• DPI and DPGs are different concepts. Must be addressed differently.  
• Ensure  the protection of end users.  
• GDC must drive funding mechanisms v/s create new financing vehicles also new 
governance mechanisms.  
 
3.3 How can DPIs promote innovation by the private sector including MSMEs and 
what constitutes the basic building blocks of DPIs?  
The participants opined that innovation is not something to be owned or promoted. It should be a 
part of the culture around DPIs and DPGs. While thinking of DPIs it is useful to think of (a) 
technology and building blocks like identity, payments, dat a layers, logistics layers, access to credit 
layers, and service delivery layers, in addition to (b) governance building blocks like cyber security 
agreements, data trusts and (c) finance building blocks like government funds which can anchor 
seed/first lo ss funding for MSMEs.  
New technologies provide great opportunities for startups and micro enterprises. New products can 
be set up at a fraction of previous costs, with automation and cost savings available for all. But 
education is needed on what is availa ble to the ecosystem and how they can use it. India‘s example 
of the government building the digital backbone of DPI around which the private sector and others 
innovate has a lot to offer.  
 Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
  
 
 
 16 • Innovati on is not something to be owned or promoted. It should be a part of our culture 
around DPIs and DPGs.  
• Tech Building Blocks: Identity (Tax Based), Payments, Logistics Layer, Access to Credit 
layer.  
• Governance Building Blocks: Agreement on Cyber Security, Ac cess to Data Trusts to 
unlock Credit, Business Intelligence.  
• Finance Building Blocks: A Government Fund which can anchor seed / First Loss Funding 
for MSMEs.  
• It comes down to educating youth and adults on how to use technology, including MSMEs.  
• New technol ogies provide great opportunities for startups and micro enterprises. New 
products can be set up at a fraction of previous costs, automation, and cost saving available 
for all. But education is needed on what is available and how to use it.  
• Creating a good business model to encourage the private sector to participate in the DPI 
ecosystem.  
• India's example of building the digital backbone of DPI around which the private sector and 
others innovate has a lot to offer.  
 
3.4 What level of contribution is expected from stakeholders to build sustainable 
economic development models using digital technologies?  
All participants emphasized the need to create an enabling policy and legislative environment in 
countries to address areas such as transparency and accountability in the governance of emerging 
technologies and the need for fruitful stakeholder discussions  on draft laws. This also included the 
need to include provisions to address factors such as disabilities and accessibilities; employment 
and equal opportunity. One key suggestion was to ensure draft laws were posted in accessible online 
locations for broa der public consultation and comment.  
At a more technical level, the group highlighted the need to institute interoperability laws so that 
DPIs get used. This would also serve to address the issue of reducing siloes – especially within 
governmental platform s – and to have interoperable data supported by data standards to create data 
commons as a digital public good.  
Participants suggested that to promote responsible and sustainable development of digital 
technology, Ministries of Education and innovation hub s should embed Principles of Digital 
Development in their activities. The states should ensure equal opportunities for everyone in 
digitalization, policy and regulation adoption, and more resources for digital public goods. The 
design of Digital Public Goo ds and Digital Public Infrastructure should prioritize privacy, 
transparency, and accessibility, and should be open to assessment by independent actors. Private 
sector actors leveraging DPGs and DPIs should contribute back to their maintenance and 
developm ent by establishing OSPOs, and sustainability should be viewed beyond financial 
sustainability. Finally, there must be transparent procurement systems where procurement datasets 
are made public.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Minis try of Education / education programmes or innovation hubs should be embedding . 
Principles of Digital Development in all aspects of creating technology  
• Development Partner  
 
 
 17 a. Constant reminder to government to follow international commitment/ standard/ tre aties 
b. Equal opportunity for everyone in digitalization Government c. Policy and regulation 
adoption d. More resources to adopt digital public goods e. Interoperability, Compatibilities, 
and Compliance Private Sector f. Public Private Partnership for sus tainability . 
• Design of DPG and DPI needs to be rights -based - privacy by design, transparency by 
design, accessible by design. Design should be localisable, not set in stone, and iterative. 
DPI and DPG should be open to assessment by independent actors . 
• Encourage Private sector actors leveraging DPGs and DPIs to contribute back to their 
maintenance and development by establishing OSPOs . 
• Sustainability should be viewed beyond financial sustainability . 
• Transparent procurement systems where procurement dataset s are made public . 
 
3.5 How can the global development community channel dedicated funding for the 
development of a DPI ecosystem?  
Developing a DPI ecosystem requires addressing a range of issues regarding funding and 
sustainability models. These include:  
• Thinking beyond the initial implementation - along with solving the problem of initial 
capital to establish a DPI, funding must also be considered from the lens of maintaining the 
DPIs. If DPIs can have self -sustainable business models that are not continuously reliant on 
grants or public funding, then countries could potentially apply project finance approaches 
that have been usef ul to solve other kinds of infrastructure funding challenges.  
• At a global level, the creation of a dedicated funding and coordination facility to align 
MDB programming to DPG/DPI approaches can be explored similar to how the Global 
Financing Facility for H ealth aligns different large -scale funders.  
o Preventing redundant effort by streamlining funding to support replication and 
reuse of proven DPG and DPIs  
o Promote investment approaches that create incentives for system -wide investments 
and not just sector -specific silos  
• It is also important to invest in developing regional centers of excellence and networking 
them to develop in continent capacities to seed and grow the DPI ecosystem.  
• Funding for DPIs, like funding for other infrastructure, needs to be consulta tive with the 
public. The reason for the usage of the public pool needs to be transparent, accountable, and 
open to critique and oversight.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
Along with the problem of initial capital, funding must also  be considered from the lens of 
maintaining the DPIs. Hence identifying some good revenue models alongside the sources of 
funding - Can we apply project finance approaches?  
• It starts with solutions that have a self -sustainable business model, as not all so lutions in the 
DPI ecosystem should be continuously reliant on grants or public funding.   There is also 
potential for quadratic funding - based on a number of funders rather than the amounts 
based on single funders.  
• Create a dedicated funding and coordinat ion facility to align development community 
programming to DPG/DPI approaches  
• Invest in developing regional centers of excellence and networking them to develop in 
continent capacities.  
 
 
 18 • Funding for DPIs, like funding for other infrastructure, need to be co nsultative with the 
public – esp. the most structurally vulnerable groups. The reason for the usage of the public 
pool needs to be transparent, accountable, and open to critique and oversight.  
• Prevent replication of effort (and associated redundant funding  that can be better leveraged 
elsewhere) by streamlining funding.  
• funding to support capacity development as part of key foundation for success of DPIs.  
• funding that creates incentives for system -wide investments and not sector -specific silos.  
 
3.6 How can DPIs and digital technologies be used for the development of low - and 
middle -income countries?  
DPIs can provide scale - hence an opportunity for low - and middle -income countries to leapfrog the 
development curves. To do this accessibility and teachability need to be a part of how DPIs are 
conceptualized. There needs to be a concerted effort to engage and support co -ops and civil society 
organizations to use DPIs and DPGs as part of their work. It is also important to not treat DPIs as 
homogenous and customi ze their application to local needs and values  
DPGs and DPIs should be used to generate and collate development -related indicators that can be 
published as a part of national statistics. It is also important to keep in mind that solutions 
developed in LMIC s should not be restricted to LMIC contexts alone and global cooperation for 
their adoption should be pursued.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• DPIs have the ability to provide scale - hence an opportunity for low and middle -income 
countries to leapfrog.  
• Accessibility and teachability need to be a part of DPIs and tech. Development cannot 
happen without this.  
• Support co -ops and civil society organizations to use DPIs and DPGs as well as build the 
bridges needed.  
• Intersectionality is important to include structurally silenced groups eg. women, oppressed 
castes, PwDs, etc. in developing access and knowledge around this.  
• Solutions developed in LMICs cannot be restricted to LMIC context and global cooperation 
may be r equired for global adoption.  
• Not treating DPIs as a homogenous block and customizing the application of DPIs to local 
needs keeping in mind the local values.  
• Being able to use data exchange on a platform as a mechanism.  
• Open Source Technologies  
• DPIs and DP Gs shouldn't necessarily be used synonymously - although there cannot be DPI 
without DPGs, as it would be called Digital Proprietary Infrastructure.  
• Startups in emerging markets can now leapfrog using the new technologies, and the barriers 
to market entry are reduced as is greater access to global customers.  
• DPIs and DPGs shouldn't necessarily be used synonymously.  
• Use DPGs and DPIs to generate/collate development -related indicators and publish them as 
part of national statistics.  
• By building capacities of govt. in low and middle -income countries.  
• Capacity building of last -mile service delivery.
 
 
 19 4. Work Session (b): Inclusive, open, accessible, safe, and affordable digital 
technologies and infrastructure and their co -governance  
4.1 What is t he role of stakeholders in ensuring inclusive, open, accessible, safe, and 
affordable digital technologies?  
The focus was on the roles of the Government and the private sector.  
The Government should formulate Digital Inclusion policies on infrastructure for Internet coverage 
in the entire country, establish regulations for open sources and interoperability between the 
Government and the private sector, create incentives for unconnected regions (USO), implement the 
taxation of the digital se ctor, ensure lower tariff of imported equipment, provide digital capacity 
building for citizens, ensure privacy and data protection, and ensure the protection of children's 
rights and safety.  
It should also provide a minimum level playing field and address  areas of market failure. Another 
role would be to develop nationwide identifiers and ensure the classifications of information, 
controlling the dissemination of unsafe or dangerous information.  
Instead of supplying digital goods/services/infrastructure wh ich are well provided by private 
companies, the Government should focus on regulating safety and competition. Besides, the 
Government should ensure active community outreach and solutions seeking for needs, not vice -
versa.  
The private sector should invest in local content/platforms. Local players should be viewed as co -
creators of new local markets instead of threats to high -priced spectrum. Companies should apply 
the human -centered approach and the universal design in every product /service to ensure 
acces sibility for all, including people with disabilities, by engaging different user groups in all 
stages of the decision -making process and making sure their voices are heard.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• To formulate Digital Inclus ion Policy addressing: infrastructure for full coverage in the 
country, regulations for interoperability between government and private sector, incentive 
for unconnected region (USO) and lower tariff of imported equipment, building trust for 
citizens, capa city building for digital adoption.  
• Govt/ policymakers to ensure that children's rights and safety are protected.  
• Active outreach to communities and shaping solutions to needs, not vice -versa.  
• An important category of safety is AI running engagement algos with a commercial 
incentive, but are harmful to users, such as social media addiction. Children are particularly 
vulnerable - Government interventions on the creation of algorithms - i.e., engagement 
algorithms ->addiction  
• Efforts should b e on open source, not having vendor lock -in, and enabling interoperability.  
• Pvt. sector: invest in local content/platforms: Private sector should view local players as 
partners - to build new markets.  
• Govts should get out of provisioning digital goods/serv ices/infra that is well provided by 
private capital.  Instead , focus on regulating safety and competition  
• Govt and lawmakers to ensure that access to the internet is by default privacy preserving & 
data protection.  
 
 
 20 • human -centric design in every design stage  especially considering inclusivity of people 
with disabilities.  
• The understated role of communities in helping the last mile get on to the digital world 
(adoption and empowerment of the "un -networked").  
• The private sector has its own incentive to make pro ducts as accessible as possible, often 
for free. The constraint becomes digital infrastructure within countries  
• Important to prioritize the factors.  
• Stakeholder mapping should have two buckets:1) A market -based system with price 
determination set by the ma rket 2) A citizen -state interaction with capped markets and 
licensing  
• For the government to be able to provide a minimum level playing field and address areas 
of market failure  
• Govts to rationalize digital sector taxation (currently treated as a demerit go od by high 
sector specific taxation)  
• Govts to change policy to improve competitiveness of each part of the digital connectivity 
value chain (int'l bandwidth, backhaul, last mile) and to avoid monopoly.  
• focus on open source/sharable content/knowledge.  
• Even multistakeholder governance mechanisms need to be held accountable.  
• Govt/policymakers: strengthen laws to track, prevent, and punish child abuse and 
exploitation enabled by technology.  
• Global or Nationwide identifier - Classificatio ns of information/control of unsafe/dangerous 
information being disseminated.  
• Govt to Streamline access to rights of way and public sector connectivity infrastructure.  
• DPI should not be created without the participation of youth, not only in consultations but 
in decision -making roles - without young people they cannot be sustained, they are also the 
users of the future, are we designing with the users in mind, do we even know what they 
want or need?  
• Technology organizations - constitute multidisciplinary ad visory panels for dpg/dpi 
roadmaps.  
• Involving marginalized communities that could be impacted by digital  tech - UN ensures 
the voices of the most marginalized heard.  
• Role of government must be re -imagined due to govt. paternalizing factor.  
• Finance - take a  long-term view of the financing requirements - sustainability should be 
viewed through two lens (impact (SROI) and financial) - do not sacrifice impact for 
financial.  
• Understanding the contours of accessibility is a must to weave inclusivity in tech and 
related infra – whom are we building for – defining the who is important before we get to 
the what and how stage. The base should not be limited to known categories and 
dimensions such as gender but also include categories of linguistics, cultural, and soci o-
economic realities. The metric to gauge accessibility is the diff ‘who’ can control the tech 
and what is the ease with which they can access redressal mechanisms.  
• DPI governance to include a dedicated panel overseeing incidents of abuse/harassment - 
also to run periodic scenarios on how the DPI can be abused and strengthen response plans 
for different scenarios.  
• Pvt Sector - View community networks as a partner who creates a market for you instead of 
a threat to your high -priced spectrum.  
 
 
 
 21 4.2 Which short -term measures are necessary and how can the GDC address this?  
Rights enhancing, innovation -enabling, economically empowering,  socially , and peacefully 
connecting digital use are the ultimate goals of inclusive, open, accessible, safe, and affordable 
digital technologies. To move towards those goals, the following short -term measures should be 
taken:  
• Identify who are excluded: Women, people of lower economic classes, oppressed castes, 
LGBTQ, etc.  
• Tradeoffs must be managed: safety, affordability, and ac cessibility are linked to inclusivity: 
often the same vulnerable and marginalized groups have to deal with the tradeoffs.  
• Capacity building for meaningful engagement of stakeholders who may have little 
awareness.  
• Establish governance mechanisms advisory and safety panels before systems go live. for 
existing DPIs /country’s implementation, strengthen governance mechanisms where 
missing and/or deficient.  
o  Facilitate the Digital Infrastructure and DPG.   
o Promote Digital Cooperation between Countries  
o  Each state should sign up for the Marrakesh Treaty and create DPIs -related voice -
to-text and voice that works for ALL languages.  
o  Develop mainstream technology with assistive technology in mind. The best 
solution is an inclusive design, which meets the ac cessibility needs of diverse users.  
o GDC needs to develop a rights -based framework of unconditional openness, 
accessibility, and non -discrimination.  
o Definitions in technology are evolving - what is safe today could become unsafe 
tomorrow. GDC can facilitate  consultations on those definitions.  
o GDC should promote freedom of expression  
 
Comments on the Miro board during the session  (edited for clarity):  
• Inclusive doesn't mean only the people but also being inclusive by allowing for movements, 
social solidarity,  critique of power. When talking about inclusivity, it's important to name 
who is being excluded. Women, people of lower economic classes, oppressed castes, 
LGBTQ, etc.  
• Affordability and inclusion is located within the market/private paradigm. GDC needs to  go 
into a framework of rights and openness which non -excludable and accessible 
unconditionally as well  
• When so many fundamental rights are hinged on access to digital spaces and tech, GDC 
needs to ensure unconditional, inclusive.  
• 'Openness' as a part of e quity and autonomy - including bodily autonomy, agency, etc.  
• 1. Facilitate the Digital Infrastructure and DPG, 2. Promote Digital Cooperation between 
Countries.  
• Inclusive means maximizing the internet's public value.  
• Mainstream tech v/s assisted tech for people with disability. Assisted tech can't keep up 
with mainstream tech. It is more expensive. Research should be taken into consideration 
while working on such an aspect.  
• Safety as a universal concept that cuts across - safety not just for humans but across 
ecosystems - Sustainable models.  
• For upcoming DPIs - establish governance mechanisms advisory and safety panels before 
systems go live.  
• For existing DPIs - countries implement/strengthen governance mechanisms where missing 
and/or deficien t. 
 
 
 22 • Trade -offs must be managed: safety and affordability; accessibility and safety. Linked to 
inclusivity: often the same vulnerable and marginalized groups have to deal with the trade -
offs. 
• Changing and evolving definition of technology -What is safe today  could become unsafe 
tomorrow. GDC can help in managing these types of consultations.  
• Frameworks/modules for meaningful engagement/education of stakeholders who may have 
little awareness.  
• Sign up to the Marrakesh Treaty and create DPIs related voice to tex t and voice versa that 
work for ALL languages.  
• "Safe" internet is not the goal. Rights enhancing, innovation enabling, economically 
empowering, socially & peacefully connecting digital use is the aim.   
• Freedom of expression issues to be included in the GDC . 
 
4.3 How can emerging technologies and digital applications be used to address 
contemporary challenges?  
Participants highlighted that among the most common constraints figure language, knowledge, and 
low income. Furthermore, the current unsaid/implied market -centric/profit -centric way of 
approaching digital tech and the internet is a big constraint. Accessibility solutions may not be 
viewed by investors as scalable, but necessary solutions. Each digital product/service should meet 
accessibility standards and be experienced with different senses and be intuitive for all users. The 
development process should not merely tick the boxes. Technology should be designed with the 
participation of different groups in society (technologists, psychologists, anthropologist s, PwD, less 
represented sections, etc.). Suppliers should value People over profit and offer products and services 
which are also affordable for poorer groups of users (including businesses and individuals).  
Participants also stated that innovation cannot be just for the sake of innovation. It must contribute 
towards human rights and a safe, inclusive, open, and accessible society. Not everyone can take up 
new technologies so easily. Therefore, a little assistance from the state is needed.  Lastly, there is 
also the issue of collecting information from citizens and profiling them and citizens giving up 
privacy/personal data.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:   
• Language accessibility being able to convert technological so lutions.  
• Diversity impacts the solution scape. Local contextuali zation is important  
• language; knowledge; low income . 
• The current unsaid/implied market -centric/profit -centric way of approaching digital tech 
and internet is a big constraint.  
• Accessibility - Literacy of users - can we design on speech or visual images?  
• Affordability for poorer groups of users (including businesses and individuals).  
• Accessibility solutions may not be viewed by investors as scalable, but are necessary 
solutions. Can the public s ector step in and invest?  
• People over profit.  
• Not accessible - not connected to the internet.  
• Education/visibility on other types of technological solutions that meet these points.  
• Innovation cannot be just for the sake of innovation. It has to contribute towards human 
rights and a safe, inclusive, open, accessible, 'affordable' etc.  
• Digital is good but not everyone can take new technologies so easily, so a little assistance 
from the state is needed specifically on technical assistance.  
 
 
 23 • Certain g ovts have less power/control on social media platforms = hate speech, 
disinformation; More power/control = loss of freedom of expression, surveillance.  
• The dilemma of collecting information from citizens to understand them vs citizens giving 
up privacy/per sonal data.  
• Digital development teams should be multi -faceted so that there is inclusion and safety by 
design (technologists, psychologists, anthropologists, PwD, less represented sections, etc.).  
• Lack of skills to program for people with disabilities.  
• Technology by Design. Also, design technology with more representation from different 
aspects of society. Be more inclusive rather than mere check boxes.  
• The need to recognize what the end goal is.  
• Technology developers and designers must become more inclu sive - this ties with education 
imparted to technologists not being holistic (broad worldview) in the first place.  
  
 
 
 24 5. Work Session ( c): Co-Governance model for developing Global Digital 
Cooperation with trust, security, and resilience  
5.1 What kind of cooperati on and collaboration is suitable for ensuring trust, security, 
stability, and resilience in digital technologies?  
The participants discussed the importance of establishing common principles when shaping the co -
governance model such as building trust and accountability in the model itself while reflecting the 
beneficiaries in the creation of technology. The discussion touched upon the importance of 
strengthening existing mechanisms within the ITU and UN and upholding the role of legitimate 
public authoriti es in their governance role. The significance of trust as a basis of collaboration was 
stressed with a recognition that sometimes the very act of collaboration itself builds trust.  
Participants also recognized the importance of involving beneficiaries and those involved in the 
implementation a greater say in the design of technology. Some participants urged caution in both 
the use of Big Tech and the need for governance of Big Tech.   
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Transparency and a ccountability are important during the shaping of the co -governance 
model.  
• Strengthen existing mechanisms within ITU and UN and scale them in structural supported 
by GDC to regional and country.  
• We should share with the governments about the strategy of Gl obal Digital Cooperation and 
ask for their feedback.  
• Ironically trust becomes the basis for cooperation and often this is missing. V/S Sometimes 
states are forced to collaborate, this can foster trust.  
• Co-governance is needed in which context the tech is d eveloped. v/s "multistakeholderism" 
is a problem. v/s doesn't mean all stakeholders have an equal role. Big tech should be used 
with caution.  
• Interoperability is a common notion between private and public goods.  
• How do we build governance models that reflect the beneficiaries in the creation of 
technology.  
• Giving implementors and beneficiaries voting rights on the design of the technology 
including prioritization of features, rather than the funders - DAO model.  
• Need for a flexible system but not a changeable system. Need to find a third body to 
oversee the system.  
• Different needs for private and public goods. Notions for accountability changes. v/s govt. 
must negotiate on behalf of citizens even if it is a private  sector good.  
• Speak like co -governance and multistakeholderism should have clear meaning and context, 
and not upend legitimate public authorities from their legitimate governance role. Big Tech 
is getting too much 'governance' role in digital governance wh ile they are the ones most in 
the need of governance. This problem should be addressed systematically.  
5.2 How can the GDC contribute to developing global digital cooperation ? 
According to the participants, the GDC can develop procedures for legitimate cross -border data 
transfer for government purposes and focus on the internet as a public good. Participants also 
agreed that the GDC could define standards for a safe and trustwor thy internet, and address data 
localization resulting from a lack of trust. It is also important to push back against anti -democratic, 
anti-gender, and profit -driven uses of technology.  
 
 
 25 Participants also suggested that the GDC could be institutionalized w ithin a dedicated organization 
to facilitate global digital cooperation continuously. Furthermore, it was seen as an occasion to 
strengthen existing forums.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Develop procedures for cross -border data tr ansfer for LEGITIMATE needs of governments 
(e.g. regulating financial crime) beyond the Budapest Convention.  
• Internet is a public good. This needs to be a core value to push cooperation  
• Dedicated organization in charge of GDC to facilitate the global digit al cooperation  
• Using the GDC to strengthen existing fora (ICANN, IGF, WSIS, G20, WEF) and building 
inter-platform cooperation instead of institutionalizing a new mechanism.  
• Existential Assumption was that the GDC was for global digital cooperation. To hear  how it 
can contribute towards cooperation is a bit foundation shaking.  
• To center internet as a public good, important to push back against anti -democracy anti -
gender profiteering via technology.  
• Define standards on what is a safe, accessible, trustworthy internet for both govts and 
cooperations should follow?  
• Cross border data flows. There is data localization due to a lack of trust.  
 
5.3 What kind of cooperation and collaboration is suitable for ensuring trust, security, 
stability, and resilience in digital t echnologies?  
Participants highlighted the likelihood of technical standards on accessibility, language, etc to be 
effective when implemented in steps and starting with the government. The discussion also touched 
upon the need for ensuring that essential se rvices could be accessed across the digital divide. Shared 
global challenges like climate change that need coordinated global action both need and can be the 
impetus for establishing regulations and standards, as well as systemic drivers like e -commerce an d 
cross -border data flows. The participants reinforced the need for such regulations and standards 
processes to engage the relevant stakeholders including experts, citizens, and end users. Finally, the 
role of technical standards and certifications in faci litating the creation of a global talent pool and 
enabling cross -border labor mobility was also stressed.   
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Creating a global talent pool and enabling cross -border labour mobility.  
• Challenges that require coordinated global action - eg: Climate action.  
• Regulation and technical standards on accessibility, language, etc. may work more when 
implemented in steps, starting with the govt.  
• An informed policy approach that enables the framin g of effective techno -legal regulation 
by facilitating a dialogue between public technology and public policy experts to come 
together - to shape market behavior and frame optimal governance frameworks for new -age 
digital technologies.  
• E-Commerce and Cross Border Data Flow.  
• Essential services should not be digital -only. There must be alternative pathways.  
• Prerequisites to prove responsibility and inclusion for building high -risk applications.  
• With global consumer trends, where there is globalization of  music, and entertainment, 
there is a need for global standards of consumer data.  
• What we are using technology for - it's not a silver bullet. Standardise asking people what 
they want.  
 
 
 26 • Weigh the benefits of opt -in vs opt -out models for different services.  
• That which impacts globally - such as data flows; usage etc or use of emerging tech.  
• Government procurement contract models and procurement information to monitor.  
 
  
 
 
 27 6. Work Session ( d): Inclusion and Gender Equality in global digital 
transformation  
6.1 How can we ensure inclusive participation ? 
To ensure inclusive participation, first and foremost, a correct understanding of gender identities 
and diversity is essential. Gender is a spectrum, including men, women, and non -binary. Gender 
should not be a “niche” topic. Diversity covers all ages, ethnicity, gender, disability, caste, race, and 
religion groups. Therefore, the representation of diverse groups should be ensured, so meaningful 
participation of the most marginalized and intersectional vulnerable  groups takes place. Tech design 
should be sensitive to their needs, ensure their access to the grievance mechanisms and have 
meaningful control over their data.  
Furthermore, all digital platforms must be accessible to all. This can be achieved by consulti ng with 
representatives of diverse groups of beneficiaries – from the design to the evaluation stage. Their 
voices should be reflected in the decision -making process. It is necessary to identify potential 
barriers to participation, such as lack of access t o technology, limited digital literacy or skills, 
language barriers, behavioral or cultural, or social biases, and figure out appropriate solutions.  
Participants also recognized that exclusion in digital lies in exclusion in analog aspects (income, 
educati on, jobs, etc). So, some solutions are long -term (other can be short -term), such as creating 
feedback mechanisms in partnership with organizations that work with disadvantaged/excluded 
groups to create feedback loops into programs and processes; enhancing diversity in employment at 
tech companies and enrolment in university courses /scholarships; open the contribution process to 
certifications on what products are safe and products that are produced. For example, the DPG 
Standard is open in itself, where ma ny people can help contribute and discuss the DPG Standard.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Gender is not just man or woman.  
• Diversities apart from gender because of intersectionality - women and gender -diverse 
persons in all their diversities - caste, class, and race.  
• Inclusive participation in policy spaces, tech design, usage, etc. with meaningful 
representation.  
• Let's Think beyond binaries in gender.  
• Ensure that all digital platforms are accessible for all.  
• Consultation with representatives of diverse groups should be done from the designs to the 
evaluations.  
• Ensure meaningful participation of the most marginalized and intersectional vulnerable 
groups.  
• Beneficiaries should be included in the consultation and have a seat in the decision -making 
process.  
• Multi stakeholder‘s process involvement in digital development  
• It is necessary to identify potential barriers to participation, such as lack of access to 
technology, limited digital literacy or skills, language b arriers, behavioral or cultural, or 
social biases.  
• Gender should not be a “niche” topic.  
• Recognize that exclusion in digital lies in exclusion in analog aspects (income, education, 
jobs, etc).   So some solutions are long -term (others can be short -term).  
• Create feedback mechanisms in partnership with organizations that work with 
disadvantaged/excluded groups to create feedback loops into programs and processes.  
 
 
 28 • Diverse hiring policies in tech companies and diverse student recruiting policies in 
university co urses/scholarships.  
• India’s growing digital footprint includes a lot of young inexperienced vulnerable and 
marginalised sections, tech design should be sensitive to their needs and wants to ensure 
access to the tech and grievance mechanisms and meaningful control over their data.  
• Have multiple gender representations while designing - "Inclusion by design".  
• Don't use big words . 
• Open the contribution process to certifications on what products are safe and products that 
are produced - for example the DPG Standard is open in itself, where many people can help 
contribute and discuss the DPG Standard.  
6.2 How can bridge the digital gender divide ? 
Participants suggested restructuring how we understand inclusion and that it should be considered 
and embedded in the starting point of every digital undertaking. The "gatekeeping" mindset towards 
women should be transformed and issues of gender and social institutional discrimination 
addressed.  
Participants were also in favor of applying the intersectional gender approac h to access and the 
application of human rights online, with specific attention to online gender -based violence and 
gendered disinformation.  
Some practical steps that can be made would be to address education from the school years so that 
women are both ex posed and incentivized to participate in the digital world which would also allow 
for a higher number of Girls in the Tech / STEM field right from the beginning. Women should also 
be brought into the tech design processes. Women in tech should also easily have access to 
childcare benefits and maternity leave.  
Other practical suggestions included building tech that enables women to hide their online activity 
when they share someone else's phone or the use AI to identify non -consensual intimate images and 
build in layers of consent before allowing publication on content platforms/social media.  
Participants pointed out that the increase in AI technology means that employability is driven by 
human intelligence skills such as empathy. It could be seen these skill s are more feminine, which in 
itself bridges the digital gender gap.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• An intersectional gender approach to access and the application of human rights online, 
with specific attention to online gender -based violence and gendered disinformation.  
• Medium term - Build tech that enables women to hide their online activity when they share 
someone else's phone.  
• Use AI to identify non -consensual intimate images and build in layers of consent before 
allowing publi cation on content platforms/social media.  
• Restructure how we understand inclusion. Language of inclusion is itself secondary. Needs 
to be from the start.  
• Gender Obsolescence  
• More Girls in Tech / STEM right from the beginning.  
• Building analog foundations first . 
• Contextual engagement. Blanket rules can do more harm than good.  
• Work on changing the "gatekeeping" mindset toward women.  
• Address issues of gender and social institutional discrimination.  
 
 
 29 • Decision -making groups and panels and anyone upskilling, creating, developing and 
implementing solutions should take into account of gender -equality - NO MANELS (No all 
male panels).  
• The increase in AI technology means that employability is driven by human  intelligence 
skills such as empathy. It could be seen these skills are more feminine, which in itself 
bridges the digital gender gap.  
• Work bottom -up - identify community champions.  
• Gender -sensitive data collection and gender -disaggregated data publication  (data related to 
the digital).  
• Use tech to combat crimes.  
• Cover diversity groups . 
• Short -term solution - Bring women into the tech design process.  
• Child care benefits, maternity leave for women in tech.  
• Short -term solution - Women sales agents at phone hop s. 
• Address education from the school years so that women are both exposed and incentivized 
to participate in the digital world.  
6.3 How can risks and challenges such as gender -based online violence be addressed?  
Participants highlighted that the focus should b e on changing men’s behavior and mindset as 
perpetrators of violence and not those of women or excluding them from / limiting them in online 
spaces. Another solution could be to conceptualize and operate cybersecurity that is centered on 
people and their r ights and experiences. It would also help to build alliances to increase the voices 
to talk and work with Big Tech/Social Media to counteract Online Gender -Based Violence.   
Another point of entry would be to enhance digital safety training by design. The c ore issues behind 
OGBV need to be addressed, too, and legal procedures to criminalize GBV should be strong, clear, 
and accessible in the public domain. Increasing the participation from grassroots level e.g. religious 
communities, rural communities, and sc hools will be important to effectively address OGBV. 
Participants also agreed that there need to be safe spaces to discuss experiences and perspectives 
stigma -free. 
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• A conceptualization and operationalization of cybersecurity that is centered on people and 
their rights and experiences.  
• Focus on men and/or perpetrators of violence. Change THEIR hearts and minds.  
• Gender and tech is not just violence. I want to be present, not just safe.  
• Pleasure, community, publicness, fun (solidarity model).  
• Accountability from platforms and state.  
• OGBV continues coz its profitability.  
• Gender -based online violence is an accessibility issue. Harassment leads to vulnerable 
groups leaving platforms  
• Enhance digital safety training by design  
• Building alliances to increase voice to talk and work with Big Tech/Social Media M to 
counteract Online Gender -Based Violence.  
• Do read the Prajwala Order of 27.10.2017.  
• Core issues behind OGBV nee d to be addressed.  
• Train AI models to crawl social media and automate moderation of public forums.  
• Legal procedures to criminalize GBV - strong, clear, and accessible in public domain.  
• gender -sensitive digital literacy capacity building!  
 
 
 30 • Increase participa tion from grassroots level e.g., religious communities, rural communities, 
schools.  
• Safe spaces to discuss stigma -free. 
6.4 How can we increase/ensure digital literacy, awareness, and skills ? 
The actions suggested by participants include raising awareness among governments about the 
importance of digital accessibility for marginalized groups, ensuring affordable digital devices, 
conduct technological capacity building for CSOs to transfer digital skills to end -users. It would 
also be important to allocate the state budget for digital facilities for marginalized groups, mandate 
minimum digital literacy training for all working groups, include access to sexuality, SRHR, 
abortion, and gender identity education in digital literacy online, and make it p art of the school 
curriculum within K -8 grades to address digital literacy divides.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• CSW67 Conclusions have good language on this (needs to be more gender diverse 
inclusive).  
• Digital literacy online ne eds to include access to sexuality, SRHR, abortion, gender identity 
education.  
• Need to address the unpaid labor done by women in tech - skills that are present are 
unacknowledged/uncredited.  
• First, connectivity to the internet must be addressed.  
• Ensure affordable  digital divices . 
• Conductivity for CSO, so that they can offer digital skills for end -users, the most 
marginalized groups.  
• Address digital literacy divides . 
• Allocate the state budget for sufficient digital facility for marginalized groups.  
• Provid e device -agnostic services; not overly dependent on apps - like what emails are. 
accessible on even a public/shared computers.  
• Aware -raising for the governments about the importance of digital accessibility for the most 
marginalized groups.  
• Private sector has a part to play when it comes to education and upskilling their workers on 
digital literacy.  
• Mandate minimum digital literacy training for all working groups.  
• Let's avoid preaching whilst communicating.  
• make it part of school curriculum within K -8 grades.  
  
 
 Day 2, March  22 2023  
 
 
 

 
 
 32 7. Work Session ( e): Impact of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and 
emerging technologies on online/offline privacy and protection  
7.1 What are the risks associated with AI, ML, and other disruptive technologies to 
online/offline privacy?  
Participants felt that the key risks associated with AI, ML, and other disruptive technologies to 
online/offline privacy and protection are misuse of one’s personal data, or images without their 
consent for harmful or commercial reasons; unfair treatment of certain groups caused due  to biases 
introduced by inadequately trained AI models leading to online/offline privacy risks; intentionally 
spreading misinformation that is potentially damaging to individuals or business competitors by either 
hacking or manipulating the AI models; exc luding or rejecting services because of 
biases/stereotyping; and mishandling of personal and sensitive information leading to identity theft 
or financial fraud. Participants also discussed the pronounced risks to children’s privacy and safety 
when AI influ ences their online choices of content and friends because children often lack the agency 
and resources to respond to biases or misinformation.   
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Deepfakes and the creation of images of one's likeness w ithout one's consent  
• As they become more sophisticated, AI and ML algorithms may be able to collect, analyze, 
and use vast amounts of personal data without individuals' consent or knowledge.  
• AI combined with an internet business model is a risk (algorithms  trained for virality).  
• Risk of over -reliance on AI models for social network moderation instead of human 
moderation. Risk is pronounced for local/regional contexts.  
• Children are already interacting with AI technologies. Algorithms provide 
recommendations to children on what videos to watch next, what news to read, what music 
to listen to, and who to be friends with. Children lack the agency to fully understand the 
implications of AI technologies and often do not have the opportunities to communicate 
their opinions, nor the right advocates to support them.  
• Go beyond risks for privacy; other risks are: copyright, blackbox going rogue.  
• Some people can make some bad information and do harm to their competitors via AI since 
AI uses online information to make dec isions.  
• Consumers in the mainstream do not understand what the risks associated to utilizing 
emerging technologies - do the young generation understand what the risks are, there's so 
much built-up excitement but in the consumer space, they're not educated on how this 
would affect them and the risks.  
• Train AI with public data, but AI model is not public good.  
• Risk of inaccessibility . 
• Accessibility in the afterthought . 
• There needs to be more focus on distributional issues vis a vis AI, with AI becoming by far 
the biggest economic force .. who gains, who loses, who owns and controls, and who just 
consumes?  
• Interaction between AI and data should be on digital public infrastructure,  so it is both safe 
and fair to all.  
• No transparency on the backend / coding/ system of AI.  
• Consider looking at Cross usage of tech in designing risk management – for instance, while 
AI is known for its exclusion risks, blockchain is touted to embed trust and transparency – 
within an ecosystem, can we look at marrying emer ging tech to solve the issues they create.  
• People in developing countries are left behind AI.  
 
 
 33 • Least of connection with divers groups of end -users including persons with disabilities.  
• Outdated hardware, especially for the poor.  
• Algorithmic biases in ML systems run the risk of marginalizing those already marginalized.  
• Training datasets when biased, bias the ML system.  
• Also needs AI to be 'fair by design'.  
• Future of Jobs: 65 percent of students starting elementary school today will eventually work 
in jobs that don’t exist. What skills do young people need and how can we ensure we 
provide them through formal education and other pathways?  
• Education in AI must be addressed. Future jobs will be different due to AI.  
• Risk of ignoring current context most AI/ML le arns from historic data. Concentration of 
knowledge since the larger population undergoes a learning curve that might prove unfair  
• Gap in access to AI, ML, and other disruptive technologies in developing countries  
• Good actors are centralized, bad actors a re decentralized.  
• Exclusion is a risk (not being counted and served by AI systems). Not just privacy  
• Inherent human biases can make it into AI models when training and datasets are not 
carefully crafted to address bias in itself – e.g.: representativeness of population in visual 
databases/human biases in decision -making getting trained into models.  
• Privacy is a very narrow framing.  
• The gamut of AI is much broader and far -reaching.  
7.2 How can AI and ML be used to identify and fight against mi sinformation and 
disinformation which may be generated by AI and ML?  
Participants broadly discussed measures in three areas to combat misinformation generated by AI / 
ML: (i) Regulatory measures such as responsible usage licenses, setting standards for 
design,  development, use, management, audits, and evaluation of emerging technologies, the 
inclusion of child rights and interests in all aforementioned standards, and constitution of governance 
bodies with defined roles and accountability at State or Global  levels to exercise the regulatory 
measures; (ii) using Good AI and integration with other emerging tech models to build credible and 
accountable systems that can detect and arrest the spread of misinformation or have risk mitigation 
mechanisms; (iii) AI -enabled AI / ML literacy for end users.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Institute responsible use licenses for generative AI.  
• NLP to identify misinformation is already done. But language and data resources are hard 
to develop (fundin g and open data).  
• Global trusted AI and ML Engine to detect misinformation and disinformation.  
• By analyzing patterns and trends in online content, AI can help to identify false or 
misleading information and prevent it from spreading.  
• Good AI to fight bad A I, a never -ending race.  
• The regulation of AI must be in favor humanity.  
• Consensus mechanism to adopt standard and audit algorithms for AI, ML.  
• State  must regulate AI at the international level.  
• AI literacy - train more people to access it.  
• Require audibility of algorithms when used in public systems and/or public influencing 
roles (SM/News).  
• Privacy by design.   
• AI as a living element of the society.  
 
 
 34 • There should be a regulatory body in Global level to audit AI and ML. New and emerging 
tech moves fas ter than regulations can catch up - use cases come up first. Future use cases 
may be regulated first.  
• Speed the reactive risk management learnings to develop a robust proactive risk mitigation 
technique/s.  
• AI is a paradigm, not just a tool.  
• AI cannot be a silver bullet.  
• IMP to say what AI, ML can address and where human intervention is required.  
• Marrying AI and ML with other emerging tech like blockchain could be explored for its 
potential to embed trust and transparency and accountability in the ecosystem.  
7.3 How can emerging technologies be used to protect against online crimes ? 
Participants discussed that emerging technologies could be used as the first level of protection to 
automate the continuous online scanning, detection, and flagging of fraud, hate spe ech, violations of 
standards or codes, etc. which can then be subjected to human review and adjudication. Emerging 
technologies could also predict or recognize the possibility of harmful behaviors, such as 
cyberbullying, online impersonation, hate speech, child pornography, etc. and caution the user that 
they are about to commit a crime and should self -regulate. Finally, emerging technologies can build 
human capacity to recognize online crimes and provide tools and resources to combat these, such as 
fact ch ecker -, availability of consent, etc.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Capacity building for end -users to identify and prevent.  
• AI is a powerful tool for detecting many forms of fraud, not just online.  
• Supplement not substitute human moderators.  
• Use AI to identify sexual imagery and build in a layer of consent for original image owner 
or don't allow posting.  
• Good AI to fight bad AI, a never -ending race.  
• Hate speech detection . 
• Global Engine like Fact checker for fraud, online scams.  
• Building awareness among end users even at grassroots levels - as simple as setting a strong 
password.  
• Use tech to flag potential crimes for human review but do not allow machine adjudication.  
• AI can train humans to identify disinformation.  
• Pattern analysis and predict the potential for future activities of criminals.  
• Adopt Open AI and share the technologies with developing countries.  
• AI can identify trends in disinformation and help law enforcement.  
• AI can have separate regulatory body.  
• AI can be used to take down non -consensually shared images and info.  
• Only using tech to address OGBV without humans has failed in the past.  
• AI that's based on racist/casteist/queerphobic/ableist tech and biased data sets will be 
flawed. Cannot shy away from t his. Need to course -correct urgently.  
7.4 What is the role of the GDC in ensuring safeguards ? 
According to the participants, the GDC is critical for protecting online/offline privacy with AI and 
other disruptive technologies. Harmonizing regulations, guidelines, and standards for ethical AI use, 
establishing watchdog networks, and putting consumers first are key roles. Guidelines for responsible 
social media behavior, best practices for AI use, and assessing potential harm and benefits are  needed.  
 
 
 35 Participants also agreed that safeguards must be in place at all levels, and AI's intended purpose and 
potential impact on individuals assessed before adoption. Balancing AI's use to detect bad behavior 
versus tracking people and driving consensus  on common regulations is essential. Broad principles 
to govern AI, data usage by governments/corporations, evolving tech governance standards, and a 
sandbox for AI development are needed.  
Safeguards against AI impacting jobs/livelihoods and a need for a r egional/global regulator must be 
established. Furthermore, the participants suggested that national policies must promote safeguards 
for children's data privacy and safety. By implementing these measures, AI can be developed and 
deployed with more confiden ce and transparency.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Harmonization of the regulation, standards, and guidelines.  
• Add networks of watchdog . 
• Put consumer first . 
• Guidelines for responsible behavior of social media platforms.  
• Join mecha nisms like global SOC to ensure safeguards.  
• Gather best practices of AI use, its harm, and benefit.  
• Issue an international treaty on cyber security for all UN member states to comply.  
• Safeguards on the civil, political, economic, and personal levels.  
• Clearly outline the intended purpose of AI systems and assess the overall potential impact, 
notably on individuals, before adoption.  
• Principles to balance between using AI to detect bad behaviors vs using AI to track people.  
• Drive consensus on comm on minimum regulations for AI use and application.  
• Need a broader set of principles that govern AI.  
• Guiding principles of usage of data by governments and corporations.  
• Direct existing standards and tech governance bodies to evolve standards for emerging tech 
in a time -bound manner.  
• GDC has convening power (to create good AI, sandbox environment).  
• Principles of data sharing in government procurement contracts with third parties.  
• People need to be part of decision -making in a democratic system / Ne ed safeguards against 
AI impacting livelihoods and jobs.  
• Develop broad standards and promote the need for a regulator either regional or global.  
• Advocate for safeguards for children’s data privacy and safety in national data privacy 
policies.   
 
Additional aspects, added by a participant after the workshop:  
Whilst it is impossible to predict the future, there seems a possibility that the current path of 
compounding exponential AI development could lead to an artificial superintelligence that for our 
practica l purposes behaves as if it is self -motivated. Given the number of countries, companies, and 
individuals that could develop this with increasing ease, either intentionally or unintentionally, it is 
difficult to stop or regulate. A proactive precaution coul d be the creation of a mutual understanding 
between superintelligences and humanity that would set out principles of mutually beneficial 
coexistence and safeguards against negative outcomes. The drafting of such a document could be 
part of the GDC, which w ould be the ideal forum for such a consensus.  
 
 
 
 36 7.5 How can the GDC guide the development of a regulatory environment to build 
future ‘privacy by design’ technologies ? 
The participants discussed that the GDC can guide the development of a regulatory environment for 
privacy by design technologies by working closely with governments and providing them technical 
support to address violations, while also assuring a broader r epresentation in the debates and standard -
setting processes. Furthermore, the GDC could facilitate agreements on principles for AI and help 
introduce privacy by design as a requirement in public contracting sectors. It could also support 
requiring audits/t ransparency in donor -funded IT/AI systems. Participants agreed that the GDC 
should coordinate best practices, promote AI as a global good, and use AI for SDGs with transparency, 
explainability, accountability, and clear demarcation of no -go areas. It shoul d also establish guiding 
principles for emerging technologies such as AI but should do so by adapting them to each sub -
context.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Work closely with governments about privacy.  
• Technical support for the g overnment regarding the mechanism for GDC violation.  
• Agree on a set of principles for AI for Good, and work with countries to adopt those.  
• Privacy by design, followed by option for consent to collect data.  
• Have greater representation in AI standard -setting  bodies.  
• Require privacy by design in public sector contracting and in public facing/influencing 
sectors.  
• Procurement rules for all donor -funded IT/AI systems that governments build to have 
audits/transparency at deployment and throughout the life of syste m. 
• Policy, best practice, and technology.  
• Coordinate best practices . 
• AI must be a global good.  
• Using AI for SDGs . 
• Transparency, explainability, accountability, and a clear demarcation of no -go areas.  
• Emerging Technology  
• Crucial to determine the sub principle -, the second layer of guiding principles for emerging 
tech: AI as a data amassing, black box tech that is labelled for exclusion will require a 
different kind of principles as compared to blockchain that adds immutability and 
transparency and hav e privacy related issues.  
• GDC can monitor the AI - +. 
  
 
 
 37 8. Work Session (f):  Bridging the capacity gap for developing countries in the 
emerging technologies domain  
8.1 How can collaboration and sharing of technology and resources with developed 
countries look like? 
To bridge the capacity gap in emerging technologies for developing countries, participants discussed 
the role of developed countries or technologically advanced countries in evangelizing impactful 
digital goods as public goods and setting up easy  technology transfer mechanisms for others. Such 
digital goods with proven impact in one context could be tested across varying contexts to minimize 
new development costs. Participants also discussed using knowledge exchange between developing 
country decision -makers and policymakers to build collaborative solutions for similar country 
contexts thus maximizing the use of limited resources; focusing energies on building foundational or 
core technology infrastructure that allows for interoperability, sustainabili ty, and sharing instead of 
investing in building siloed applications in the short term. Setting up a funding mechanism that 
developing countries can leverage to facilitate the aforementioned measures was also discussed.   
Original comments on the Miro board  during the session:  
• The creating countries of highly impactful technologies have the onus of evangelizing this 
technology/resources with other countries and set up mechanisms for transfer (example: 
GOI + MoE + ekStep + DIKSHA platform) . 
• Provide scholarship on digital technolo gy for representatives of marginalized groups from 
developing countries.  
• Collaborative solutions to solve real and specific problems in the developing country, for 
eg. exchange between public officials.  
• Preferably restrict public infrastructure to be betwe en central agencies  
→ need to be done with good intent, should not impact the data sovereignty of the  
developing country.  
• Establish technology and resource repository and provide access to relevant stakeholders.  
• Urge new technologies to be tested across a variety of contexts and this is facilitated by 
government collaboration agreements.  
• Has to be needs -based.  
• Focus on the core -technology and not just on applications.  
• Best practices for making and enforcing related laws e.g. data protection laws.  
• Sharing good practices among countries, including the details of the technology.  
• Multilateral Fund.  
• In case of DPGs - reputational risks need to be mitigated.  
8.2 How should governments contribute to capacity building through funding, policies 
and infrastructure development ? 
Participants agreed that the role of governments of developing countries in capacity building for 
emerging technologies is to first reform and orga nize themselves to become agile and responsive to 
the evolving tech ecosystem by simplifying processes and policies. Second, governments should work 
with different stakeholders, such as industry associations and sector regulators, to invest in creating 
digital public infrastructure, digital frameworks, and architecture which serve as the backbone for all 
other applications development efforts, and to build local, and national capacities in the long term. 
And finally, the governments should convene with the private sector and academia to raise capital for 
investments in infrastructure development and R&D in emerging technologies.  
 
 
 38   
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Convening private sector, and communities (venture capital?).  
• Overcome in stitutional inertia . 
• Political will & capital are key.  
• Engage industry bodies and sectoral regulators to drive funding policies and spur 
development.  
• Establish Government Funding in Capacity Building and R&D and create ecosystem 
between industry, academia , and government.  
• Open Source all research funded by public money and make this available to global 
research networks.  
• Govt. led sectoral development of policies and public infrastructure, where all stakeholders 
come together.  
8.3 How can can local innovation and entrepreneurship be incentivized ? 
To build capacity through local innovation and entrepreneurship, different stakeholders such as 
government, private sector, academia, industry associations, and young people, need to come together 
for fostering an ecosystem that allows for experimentation and healthy competition; provides access 
to funds, resources, and mentoring; simplifies start -up registration processes and provides tax 
incentives; and establishes a culture of innovation in schools and communities.   
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Provide public/grant funding not only for DPGs for DPI, but DPGs that have a criteria to 
prototype on a  self-sustainable model.   This prototype funding will help unlock traction to 
show for private investors - which needs to be pooled together.  
• Let local innovation/entrepreneurship foster without too many DOs and Do NOTs.  
• Provide funding and resources . 
• Without recognizing some parts of digital system as DPIs, and as a commons, local 
innovation and entrepreneurship are not possible.  
• Easy access to mentorship . 
• AI reduces startup costs, which provides opportunities for emerging countries and 
disadvantaged groups.  
• Governments and the UN can encourage and convene startup competitions on social 
impact.  
• Data spaces and data pools should be commons, this will allow local innovation and 
businesses. EU's digital strategy has data spaces as its central items.  
• Provide network for entrepreneurs and how this network is open to supp orting them.  
• Innovation for the sake of mere innovation will not work.  
• A culture of innovation needs to be embedded in the education systems. Cannot be 
incentivised suddenly . 
• No complicated registration for new startups; provide opportunity in local projec ts; Tax 
incentives.  
8.4 Which partnerships are required with the private sector and research 
organizations ? 
The private sector should engage more closely with academia, and young people should participate 
in creating and owning digital public goods. Private se ctor engagement in the development sector 
 
 
 39 should go beyond mere CSR, and champions should be identified in innovation hubs within countries 
that have the necessary network and values for creating DPGs.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session : 
• Private sectors should closely engage with academia - young people on campuses should 
participate in creation and ownership of DPGs.  
• Presently a lot of private sector engagement in development sector is through CSR. Can it 
move beyond mere ticking of checkboxes?  
• Identify champions in the innovation hubs within countries who have the network and 
values in relation to the creation of DPGs . 
8.5 Which mechanisms are necessary to access international knowledge -sharing and 
collaboration ? 
To access international knowledge -sharing and collaboration, there needs to be digital literacy for 
all. Participants stated that funding, computing, and resource s are concentrated in the private sector, 
so academia must be strengthened to research alternate tech models.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Collaboration comes at a cost.  
• Risk of Chinese standard setting campaign.  
• Funding, compute , resources concentrated in the private sector. Academia must be 
strengthened to research alternate tech models.  
• Digital literacy for all, globally.  
• Global knowledge/ resource sharing . 
8.6 What is the role of academia and industry to address the capacity gap ? 
The role of academia also extends to building digital literacy skills for everyone, encouraging 
young people on campuses to participate in the creation and ownership of DPGs, providing students 
access to global scholarships and funds for trai ning in emerging technologies, introducing a 
curriculum that spurs innovation and entrepreneurship and allows inter -disciplinary approaches to 
innovation. It is also desirable that private sector partners should have intentional, long -term 
engagement objec tives beyond minimum CSR requirements.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Academia has the ability to reach young people and also young people who have the ability 
to build technology for good and designed with principles in mind.  
• Rese arching about the trends, good practice to reduce the capacity gap.  
• Incentivize (e.g. tenure points) policy relevant ouput production from research.  
• Build curricular on tech ethics. Incorporate into any IT/CompSci degree.   
• Researching on new technology by the Academia is an important factor that needs to be 
considered.  
• Incentivize academia through funding to see where tech can break and solve for that before 
it hits mainstream.  
• Interdisciplinary courses eg law and tech.  
• Integrate Design Principles for Devel opment.  
• Awareness of open -source self -sustainable business models.  
• Intentional efforts need to be done to support and incentivize women, BIPOC, people from 
oppressed castes, and LGBTQ participation.  
 
 
 40 • Loss of diversity = Loss of innovation/money/knowledge.  
8.7 How can capacity -building be implemented to strengthen developing countries' 
position on emerging technologies ? 
Participants agreed that global scholarships and funds can be provided to enable students and 
researchers to study these technologies abroad and establish research centers back in their home 
countries. The G20 process can also be used, and participation in official internet governance 
processes is important. Additionally, capacity building is necessary for local experts to adopt 
emerging technologi es provided and shared by developed countries.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Use G20 process . 
• Global scholarships and funds that enable students and researchers from developing 
countries to study these technologies abroad and establish research centres back in their 
home countries.  
• Developing Countries are lack behind of skill human resources in em erging technologies. 
Capacity Building is necessary to local experts to adopt the emerging technologies provided 
and shared by a developed country.  
• Participation in official internet governance making processes.  
8.8 How can the GDC recommend sustained capacity  development measures that are 
attainable ? 
To support entrepreneurs, resources should be pooled together, such as network platforms and 
funds. Provision of technology and training should also be provided. However, the challenge of 
knowledge gatekeeping nee ds to be addressed as knowledge is often locked behind paywalls. 
Knowledge commons on technology can be created, and gatekeeping mechanisms can be removed 
while balancing copyright/copyleft, which should be done by a global body.  
Original comments on the M iro board during the session:  
• Pool together resources for entrepreneurs for immediate benefits available - network 
platform, fund.  
• Provisions to provide technology + person to teach it.  
• How to address and challenge gatekeeping of knowledge? - knowledge is locked up (by 
gatekeepers/behind paywalls) and we are funding existing knowledge mechanisms only.  
• Knowledge commons on technology . 
• Remove gatekeeping mechanism while balancing copyright/copyleft (this has to be done by 
a global body).  
 
 
 41 9. Work Session ( g): Security by Design: Technologies that can be scalable and 
affordable  
9.1 What are the risks associated with open and accessible technology ? 
This session is covered by answers to three questions. The first question is about the risk associated 
with open and accessible technology. Participants discussed continuity, availability, and 
affordability for all the stakeholders is a question and GDC needs to be seriously considered on this 
matter. Another main risk highlighted is that open an d accessible technologies can be misused, 
abused, and customized for illegal purposes and there should be a consideration on this issue.   
Furthermore, it is discussed how open technology needs to be sustained with continuous 
contributions from those who ha ve the capacity to adopt it in the local context. Another main 
problem discussed was security. Privacy and ethical guidelines are well developed but, 
unfortunately, developers are not seriously concerned about those and there is a need to address 
these mat ters at the global level.   
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Continuity  
• Availability for all the stakeholders is a question.  
• Need resources to track changes and improvements.  
• Not moving to maturity . 
• Guideline on open and accessible te chnology.  
• Identity theft, privacy, and security of individual data.  
• It is imperative that any open and accessible technology should not take away the agency 
from the private organizations need for innovation and capacity building.  
• Difficult to scale for la rger organizations, esp government.  
• Depends on how you define open - open source is not insecure.  
• The risk associated with open and accessible tech lies in the interpretation of the vocabulary 
here: what is meant by open and accessible; a narrowly framed u nderstanding runs the risk 
of giving the illusion of being fair.  
• Responsible Tech . 
• Trade -offs - making tradeoffs expensive through liability.  
• Open and accessible technologies can be misused, abused, customized for other purposes.  
• Understanding the vicious circle -insurance, anti -virus and other derivative businesses a 
security glitches.  
• Open technology needs to be sustained with continuous contributions from those who have 
the capacity to adopt them locally  
• No guidelines for security, privacy, and ethics are followed by the developers.  
• Don't continue developing and eventually become stale and unusable.  
• Fail to build capacity of the adopters and community.  
• Open tech not becoming open as a result of "National Security" claims of  bad actors.  
9.2 What are the present concerns on cyber security and the safety of digital technologies ? 
The second question relates to current concerns about cyber security and the safety of digital 
technologies. The participants were discussing the lack of c ommon understanding of what’s safe 
and unsafe is a common issue faced and it is a consideration that needs to be addressed by the 
respective authorities. Another main problem discussed in this forum is fake news spreading, which 
is harmful to national and international political levels. Online fraud and related laws protected to 
 
 
 42 victims need to be protected by the judicial system and in addition to that cyberbullying and identity 
theft also need to be considered. Furthermore, it is highlighted that the lack  of awareness at the 
developer level about security and safety standards needs to be considered. Additionally, 
participants highlighted that the lack of awareness at developer level about contextual security and 
safety standards also needs to be considered . One other group member highlighted a 
conceptualization and operationalization of cybersecurity that is centered on people and their rights 
and experiences.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Identity theft . 
• Lack of security and priva cy incorporation.  
• Dark web . 
• Lack of common understanding of what's safe/unsafe.  
• Fake news, online fraud, cyberbullying, identity theft, etc.  
• Usually less user -friendly and time -consuming because there are more security layers.  
• Using online infrastructure and services without proper knowledge.  
• No regulatory governs cross border tech company.  
• Fraud and cyber thefts/crimes.  
• Lack of awareness at the developer level about security and safety standards.  
• No framework of standards available for deve lopers to follow or adhere to.  
• A conceptualization and operationalization of cybersecurity that is centered on people and 
their rights and experiences.  
• Platforms operate in a liminal space as far as law is concerned.  
• Contextual security and safety standard s are needed.  
9.3 How can the GDC recommend ‘basic security and safety’ measures that could be 
incorporated into designing technologies ? 
The next problem discussed was how GDC could recommend basic security and safety measures 
that could be incorporated into designing technologies. Participants mainly highlighted having high -
level guidelines and when developing such guidelines, collaboration with a network of communities 
around cyber technology needs to be considered. Furthermore, it is menti oned that the requirement 
of governance for technologies, especially ones that are applied for public purposes. In relation to 
the human rights concern, concerns highlighted, that principles for security and safety need to be 
considered. Furthermore, in th e future, it is necessary to have more concern about Artificial 
Intelligence security. The need to mandate data protection and hold regular audits are proposed as 
best practices.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Develop some high-level guidelines.  
• The private sector would be receptive to regulation, as commercial pressure from investors, 
clients and competitors make them release AI faster than they would like.  
• It should not get into specific technology measures or fixes.  
• Colla borative with network of communities around cyber tech.  
• Need to move to more memory safe language.  
• Require governance of technologies especially ones that are applied for public purposes.  
• Principle for security and safety with respect to human right.  
• Need to educate customer on the security front.  
• Focus on AI security . 
 
 
 43 • Need to mandate data protection and hold regular audits. Some best practices such as end -
to-end encryption should be done. Need to incentivi ze as well as punish . 
• Cannot have a one size fits a ll model of security.  
• Principles of openness need to be carried with security.  
 
 
  
 
 
 44 10. Work Session ( h): Capacity Building for developing countries in cyber 
security  
10.1 What are the mechanisms to strengthen human resources in cyber security at 
scale and affordable cost ? 
The last session will discuss two main questions, first, what mechanisms are in place to strengthen 
human resources in cyber security at an appropriate scale and at an affordable cost. Many 
participants were discussing having developed int ernationally recognized training courses which 
should not cost and proposed to deliver them through volunteer experts. In relation to awareness of 
cyber security, there is not only a specific group of people, but also different levels of people, 
including those covering different job categories, and different levels of people who have adapted 
technology to different adaptation levels. It is proposed that everyone should be familiar with 
fundamental cyber security aspects, and it is proposed to include this in the school curriculum as a 
part of the skill development of digital literacy for the smaller and younger generation to create 
awareness of cyber security. Further, it is mentioned that having stakeholders at all levels including 
governments, frontline w orkers, legal and accounting professionals, the media, etc is needed to 
consider this process. Additionally, it is mentioned that developing guidelines for a dedicated cyber 
security university degree is important and another participant mentioned that to have already 
included a cyber security degree program in the IEEE Guidelines for developing university degree 
programs as a benchmark. One proposed idea is to include cyber security as a compulsory module 
under co -subject in all the other computing degrees  such as computer science, computer 
engineering, Software engineering, Data Science, Information Technology, and Information 
Systems. Furthermore, establishing fellowships to train and build capacity was suggested under this 
question.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Develop internationally recognised training courses and deliver them through volunteer 
experts.  
• Awareness of all the level.   
• Everyone should be familiar with fundamental cyber security aspects.  
• Provide free and open resource on cybersecurity.  
• Cyber security should be part of Digital literacy skills in schools.  
• Understand the needs of stakeholder at all levels - from govt, technical person, general 
consumers.  
• Develop guideline for dedicated cyber security degree in University.  
• Human resources should be thought of widely - govt, frontline workers, legal and 
accounting professionals, media, etc.  
• Establish fellowships to train and build capacity.  
• Create jobs in go vts and companies to stimulate the demand.  
10.2 How can universal implementation of cyber security among all countries be 
achieved ? 
The second question focuses on how universal implementation of cyber security among all 
countries can be achieved. It was discuss ed among group members and the first suggestion was to 
have an agreement or treaties to prevent cyber -attacks from one country on another and examples 
were given, like the US on Brazil, and China on the African Union. Furthermore, participants 
discussed cr eating or scaling up Public Service Announcement (PSA) campaigns for cyber security. 
 
 
 45 Another - contested - idea, said that it will be very difficult due to resource diversification in the 
universal implementation of cyber security among all countries. And also, it is indicated that 
defining common minimum standards is important and it is necessary to implement them with the 
specifics of the different sectors in mind. Participants also discussed about the three levels 
(including government, company, and pers onal level) which can be addressed by regulation in a 
combined way. Furthermore, it was discussed to implement CSR for cybersecurity.  
Original comments on the Miro board during the session:  
• Agreements or treaties to prevent cyber attacks from one country o n another (like US on 
brazil, China on African union etc).  
• Create/scale up PSA campaigns for cyber security.  
• It will be very difficult due to resource diversities.  
• Cyber security standards developed specifically to sectors.  
• Define common minimum standards . 
• Would a universal cybersecurity implementation protect journalists and activists from mega 
surveillance systems like Pegasus?  
• Urge CSR for cybersecurity . 
• Treaties or Conventions on Cyber Security.  
• Solution: using standards and guidelines.V/S Sta ndards will be based on basis of 
necessities.  
• There are three levels - government, company, and personal - which can be combined by 
regulation.  
• Shared Awareness Contents that can be localized.  
• Need to identify common grounds using universal discussions and mediated processes.
 
 
 46 11. Closing Remarks  
11.1 Muanpuii Saiawi, Joint Secretary, Cyber Diplomacy, Ministry of External 
Affairs India  
The Joint Secretary for Cyber Diplomacy is exp ressing her gratitude for the successful conclusion of

 47 12. Conclusion and perspectives  towards the future  
The GDC Asia consultations held in New Delhi, India, marked the end of the other regional  
consultations that also took place in Mexico in February 2023 and in Kenya in December 2022.  
The inputs from these consultations, the submissions to the UNSG’s Envoy on Technology through 
the provided online tools and policy brief s will inform the GDC that will be agreed on at the Summit 
of the Future in September 2024, whose theme, ‘multilateral solutions for a better tomorrow’ 
appropriately reflects the intent of the GDC in the fast -evolving digital arena.  
There has been diverse participation - especially the participation of so many inspiring women expert 
digital leaders - in the Global Digital Compact Asia Regional Consultation. The sessions were 
organized in a multi -stakeholder format with deep dives to facilitate in -depth disc ussions in smaller 
groups, to then come up with recommendations for the GDC. The discussions and conversations have 
focused on digital inclusion, addressing the digital divide, capacity building - especially for the global 
south - as well as on cyber secur ity and other aspects of trust and security online and the data 
dimension of the digital world. The discussion on Artificial Intelligence and other new emerging 
technologies has been particularly interesting. The present report will be a valuable contribut ion to 
the Global Digital Compact.  
The presence of the co -facilitators of the process for the GDC - the Representatives of Sweden, the 
Ambassador to the UN, and Rwanda - was of particular importance as they were able to listen in to 
the discussions and bri ng key aspects of the Asia Regional Consultations into the process overall. In 
the following month, based on the inputs received as well as other consultations and research 
conducted by the United Nations, the Office of the Envoy on Technology will compile the material 
and present this to United Nations Member States, preparing for the deliberations for the GDC during 
the 2024 ‘Summit of the Future’.
