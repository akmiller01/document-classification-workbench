ICANN
Submission
to
the
Global
Digital
Compact
The
Internet
Corporation
for
Assigned
Names
and
Numbers
(ICANN)
is
pleased
to
submit
views
to
the
Global
Digital
Compact.
ICANN’ s
views
will
relate
to
the
following
areas:
(1)
Connect
all
people
to
the
Internet,
including
all
schools;
and
(2)
A void
Internet
fragmentation.
ICANN
is
a
nonprofit
public
benefit
corporation
with
a
global
community
dedicated
to
keeping
the
Internet
secure,
stable,
and
interoperable.
ICANN
coordinates
the
Internet’ s
unique
identifier
systems,
which
enable
people
all
over
the
world
to
connect
from
any
device
that’ s
connected
to
the
Internet.

Connect
all
people
to
the
Internet,
including
all
schools
The
Internet's
transformative
power
is
well
established
around
the
world.
It
provides
significant
socioeconomic
benefits
and
serves
as
the
foundation
for
the
digital
economy .
The
Internet
is
inextricably
linked
to
the
achievement
of
the
sustainable
development
goals
(SDGs)
–
some
of
which
may
not
be
realized
without
the
potential
of
technologies
such
as
the
Internet.
According
to
the
International
T elecommunication
Union's
(ITU)
2022
Information
and
Communications
T echnology
(ICT)
estimates,
5.3
billion
people
(roughly
66%
of
the
world's
population)
are
now
online.
That
is
a
remarkable
achievement
which
may
have
1
seemed
implausible
just
five
years
ago
when
only
half
of
the
world
was
connected.
However ,
the
COVID-19
pandemic
galvanized
governments
and
stakeholders
(including
the
technical
community ,
network
operators,
Internet
service
providers,
businesses,
civil
society ,
and
others)
into
action
to
expand
Internet
connectivity ,
demonstrating
the
importance
of
multistakeholder
collaboration.
The
Internet's
success
is
partly
due
to
its
unique
technical
design,
the
standards
and
pr otocols
that
enable
communication
between
devices,
as
well
as
the
collaboration
among
diverse
stakeholders,
which
is
essential
for
a
distributed
system
comprised
of
thousands
of
networks.
The
multistakeholder
model
has
proven
to
be
ef fective
in
expanding
the
Internet.
It
remains
the
most
viable
approach
for
fostering
collaboration
among
relevant
stakeholders
to
expand
the
Internet.
Connecting
those
that
are
still
of fline
is
an
objective
that
remains
within
reach
with
some
considerations.

According
to
the
ITU’ s
ICT
statistics
for
2022,
developing
and
least
developed
countries
are
the
least
connected.
Expanding
Internet
connectivity
is
a
critical
step
toward
closing
the
digital
divide.
Digital
inclusion
is
also
an
important
factor
to
consider .
Most
of
the
world
does
not
use
Latin
scripts
or
speak
English
as
a
first
language.
There
are
approximately
7,000
languages
spoken
worldwide,
at
least
half
of
them
written.
Consequently ,
many
people
are
unable
to
benefit
fully
from
the
Internet
because
it
is
not
available
in
their
preferred
language
or
script.
Access
to
the
Internet
will
only
increase
through
digital
inclusion.
People
should
be
able
to
use
the
Internet
in
their
native
languages
and
scripts
as
it
gr ows
to
include
mor e
Internet
users.
The
aforementioned
would
give
people
speaking
diverse
languages
a
more
meaningful
online
experience.
It
would
enable
them
to
participate
in
the
digital
economy
and
have
access
to
a
vast
array
of
applications
and
services,
such
as
e-government
services,
healthcare,
financial
services,
e-learning
and
educational
materials,
and
so
on.
ICANN
and
its
global
community
ar e
committed
to
expanding
the
Internet
with
the
continuous
development
and
pr omotion
of
Internationalized
Domain
Nam
e
(
IDN)
T op
Level
Domains
(TLDs)
to
ensur e
a
truly
multilingual
Internet.
ICANN's
global
community
has
been
working
on
IDNs
for
many
years
to
increase
the
accessibility
of
the
Internet
and
the
Domain
Name
System
(DNS)
for
the
diverse
populations
of
the
world.
However ,
despite
the
availability
of
IDNs,
barriers
remain
to
their
use,
which
are
complex
in
nature.
It
is
particularly
important
to
guarantee
that
all
domain
names—including
TLDs,
IDNs,
and
email
addresses—are
treated
equally
and
can
be
used
by
all
valid
Internet-enabled
applications,
devices,
and
systems,
regardless
of
script,
language,
or
character
length.
This
is
done
by
facilitating
the
awareness
and
adoption
of
Universal
Acceptance
(UA).
UA
is
a
technical
requirement
that
ensures
all
valid
domain
names
and
email
addresses
regardless
of
language,
script,
or
length
are
accepted
and
can
be
used
by
all
Internet
users.
UA
is
a
fundamental
requirement
for
a
truly
multilingual
and
digitally
inclusive
Internet.
This
will
require
or ganizations
and
businesses
to
upgrade
their
systems
and
services
to
ensure
they
will
work
in
the
continuously
expanding
and
evolving
domain
name
space.
The
Universal
Acceptance
Steering
Group
(UASG),
a
volunteer -led
group
supported
by
ICANN,
is
working
to
address
these
issues,
in
addition
to
promoting
and
raising
awareness
of
IDNs
and
UA.
The
first
Universal
Acceptance
Day
or ganized
by
the
UASG
took
place
on
28
March
2023
to
rally
local,
regional,
and
global
communities
and
or ganizations
around
the
world
to
raise
awareness
of
UA
and
encourage
its
adoption
by
all
stakeholders.

In

ICANN
joined
the
ITU
Partner2Connect
Digital
Coalition,
a
multistakeholder
alliance
aimed
at
promoting
meaningful
connectivity
and
digital
transformation.
ICANN
pledged
to
provide

ICANN’ s
Coalition
for
Digital

launched
in
2022,
is
a
multistakeholder
initiative
(consisting
of
governments,
regional
and
international
or ganizations,
and
the
local

community)
that
aims
to
support
Africa's
digital
transformation.
The
Coalition
supports

Cor e
Principles:

Connecting

The

recognized
that
all
stakeholders
–
not

have
a
role
to
play
in
digital
transformation.
The
spirit
of
multistakeholder
collaboration
enshrined
by
the

has
contributed
to
the

growth.
The
multistakeholder
model
of
Internet
governance,
which
is
fundamental
for
the

should
be
pr eserved

A void
Internet
Fragmentation
The
Internet
enables
communication
between
devices
all
over
the
world,
regardless
of
location
or
type
of
Internet
Protocol
(IP)-enabled
device.
Its
core
attributes
of
openness,
interoperability ,
and
resilience
ensure
that
the
Internet
is
available
to
everyone.
Essentially ,
its
distributed
architecture
allows
anyone
who
wants
to
connect
to
the
global
Internet
to
do
so.
Furthermore,
the
more
networks
are
connected,
the
more
resilient
the
Internet
becomes.
ICANN
and
other
or ganizations
play
an
important
role
in
the
technical
operations
of
the
Internet,
ensuring
that
communications
reach
their
intended
destination
while
remaining
secure.

stating
that
"total
global
Internet
usage
increased
40%
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
lockdowns."
During
this
period,
the
Internet
proved
to
be
resilient,
demonstrating
its
ability
to
withstand
a
sur ge
in
demand
and
scale
to
add
millions
of
new
users
who
were
previously
of fline.
For
example,
to
assess
the
impact
of
the
COVID-19
pandemic
on
the
DNS,
ICANN
conducted
tests
and
analyzed
traf fic
data
to
measure
and
test
the
resilience
built
into
the
DNS.
These
measurements
and
studies
demonstrated
that
the
DNS
handled
the
increase
in
traf fic
and
proved
its
resiliency
by
responding
flawlessly
to
the
new
challenges.
T oday ,
the
Internet’ s
technical
operations
ar e
sound
and
able
to
meet
the
challenge
of
connecting
the
r emaining
33%
of
the
world’ s
population
who
ar e
curr ently
offline.
ICANN
and
its
multistakeholder
community-driven
policy
development
process
ensures
that
the
DNS
continues
to
be
secure
and
resilient.
The
security ,
stability ,
and
resiliency
of
the
Internet
contributes
toward
the
achievement
of
the
SDGs
.
While
the
technical
underpinning
of
the
Internet
works
well,
some
policy
actions
to
address
how
the
Internet
is
used
(applications
and
services)
may
have
unintended
consequences
that
could
lead
to
Internet
fragmentation.
Recognizing
the
distinction
between
these
two
aspects
(the
Internet’ s
functioning
versus
the
use
of
the
Internet)
can
aid
in
a
better
understanding
of
the
issues
at
hand,
while
also
ensuring
that
relevant
stakeholders
can
participate
and
contribute
in
the
shaping
of
more
ef fective
national
policies
that
enable,
rather
than
harm,
the
Internet.
Multistakeholder
platforms
such
as
the
Internet
Governance
Forum
(IGF)
have
proven
to
be
an
appropriate
venue
for
all
stakeholders—governments,
private
sector ,
civil
society ,
the
technical
community—to
gather
and
discuss
issues
related
to
the
Internet.
A
commitment
by
all
stakeholders
to
foster
and
support
multistakeholder
collaboration
on
important
policy
aspects
is
a
crucial
step
toward
avoiding
Internet
fragmentation
and
ensuring
that
the
global
Internet
is
available
for
futur e
generations.
