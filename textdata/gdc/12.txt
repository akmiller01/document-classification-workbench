4 1 Executive Summary  
The development of a Global Digital Compact is one of the proposals arising from the UN Secretary -
General’s report titled ‘Our Common Agenda’ report of September 2021. In this regard, consultations 
at various levels have commenced with three regional consultations  in Kenya, Mexico, and India 
schedul ed to provide an opportunity for input into the draft GDC that will be tabled for adoption at the 
Summit of the Future in September 2024.  
This report is a summary of the discussions of the first regional consultations held in Nairobi, Kenya 
on 5-6 Decembe r 202 2 bringing  together stakeholders drawn from government, civil society, private 
sector actors, international organisations, academia/research, and technical community from across 
the African region  to reflect on Africa’s priorities and interests in the GDC. The Africa  consultations 
were in the form of presentations by key speakers, questions  and a nswer  sessions, and  three  
interactive b reakout sessions of three groups. There were three guiding thematic areas : sustainable use 
of digital technologies in the 21st Century: achieving the 2030 agenda and strengthening human 
rights; protecting a global, open, free, and secure internet , and the impact of artificial intelligence and 
emerging technologies .   
From the consultations the key recommendations along the three key sub -themes can be summarised 
as follows:  
Sub-theme 1: Sustainable use of digital technologies in the 21st Century: Achieving the 2030 
Agenda and strengthening human rights :  
a. Africa is not just a market for technologies there is thus a need to respect the agency, input, 
and contribution of the continent;  
b. There is a need to ensure meaningful inclusion of ALL populations including women, 
children, and people with disabilities in policy consultations  for the development of 
technological solutions to avoid the perpetuation of further inequality and create a safe and 
secure digital environment for all;  
c. Human rights considerations need to be at  the core of any digital technology service 
interventions;  
d. Make digital technologies affordable, accessible, and of good quality; by addressing existing 
challenges such as inadequate infrastructure in certain regions;  
e. Ensure GDC is not elitist;  
f. Continuous efforts towards capacity building for policymakers and the general population 
through education and research;  
g. Governments need to be proactive in developing enabling and regulating policies for 
emerging technologies; and  
h. There is a need for collaboration  between and among actors in government and the private 
sector in addressing the existing gaps and challenges.  
Sub Theme 2: Protecting a global, open, free, and secure internet : 
a. Systematically reinforce the African voice, to avoid replicating existing inequalities in the 
offline World into the digital space;  
b. Invest in digital literacy and safe use of the internet ; including sensitisation on  cyber security 
to protect particularly vulnerable persons ; 
5 c. Ensure better clarity on the notions of digita l rights, privacy rights, and internet openness and 
ensure adequate regulatory balance to guarantee respect for the fundamental rights for all;  
d. Facilitate meaningful public participation by availing resources for public participation in this 
regard, the GDC can become a platform for continuous engagement ; 
e. Consider i ndependent continental regulation  to ensure context -responsive interventions; and  
f. Encourage investments in African solutions developed by Africans .  
Sub Theme 3: T he impact of artificial intell igence and emerging technologies in advancing 
technological innovation while protecting human rights : 
a. Promote the responsible and collaborative use of AI for the public good 
(education/health/climate etc.);  
b. Enhance representation of  Africa  in decision -making at  the global standard -setting bodies 
e.g., ISO, ITU -T. There is thus a need to enhance the meaningful participation of Africa by 
supporting consistent multi -stakeholder participation ;  
c. Be intentional in mitigating the implications of AI  on economic opportunities/job 
environment in Africa;  
d. Sustainable investment in awareness creation, capacity building, and the proactive response to 
the dynamism in AI;  
e. Promote evidence -based deployment of AI and other technologies;  
a. Ensure adequate balanc e between regulation and innovation;  
f. Enhance collaboration between various stakeholders in the sector and a multidisciplinary  and 
multi -stakeholder approach to regulation; and  
g. View the GDC as a living document and a continuing platform for  stakeholder eng agement.  
 
The Nairobi GDC consultations were made possible through the collaboration of the Government of 
Kenyan , the German Federal Foreign Office and the Office of the UN Secretary General’s Envoy on 
Technology, Mr. Amandeep Gill. This report was developed by Ms. Sarah Wesonga and Ms. Jane 
Muhia of ARTICLE 19 Eastern Africa.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 2 Background  
In September 2020, on the commemoration of the seventy -fifth anniversary of t he United Nations, 
member states adopted a political declaration , Guided by the Charter, on how they are going to ensure 
the future they want and the United Nations they need. Consequently, in September 2021 the UN 
Secretary -General published his report entitled “ Our Common Agenda ,” which proposes a Global 
Digital Compact (hereinafte r ‘GDC’) that seeks to “outline shared principles for an open, free and 
secure digital future for all.” The proposed Global Digital Compact is set to be agreed upon at the 
Summit of the Future  in September 2024.  
It is against this background that the Kenyan and German governments in cooperation with the Office 
of the UN Secretary -General’s Envoy o n Technology, held multi -stakeholder consultations on the 
Global Digital Compact, in Nairobi, Kenya, on 5 – 6 December 2022. The consultations, led by the 
UN Secretary General’s Envoy on Technology, Mr. Amandeep Gill, aimed to provide a forum to 
discuss ho w the future GDC  can facilitate the use of digital technologies for the realisation of the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and enhance digital access for societies across the Global 
South and provide an opportunity for various stakeholders to inpu t into the GDC. The consultations 
further aimed to enable discussions about how risks and challenges associated with new technologies 
can be addressed by anchoring principles for responsible use inside the GDC.  
2.1 Introduction  
The workshop Consultations were moderated by Martin Reinfeldt and Joy Doreen Biira. Day 1 of the 
consultations was live -streamed on YouTube and can be accessed here. General resources from the 
workshop including the agenda, presentations, s urveys , and key messages can be accessed on this 
Miro  board .  
2.2 Objectives of the consultation  
A. Contribute to the exchange of ideas about the potential as well  as the challenges in the future 
use of digital technologies.  
B. Represent your organisations, companies or offices' knowledge and standpoint on principles 
for an open, free and secure digital future for all.  
C. Develop, together with other stakeholders, tangi ble recommendations for elements to be 
included in the Global Digital Compact.  
3 High -Level Segment/Welcoming Speeches  
3.1 UN Secretary -General’s Envoy on Technology, Under -Secretary -General Mr 
Amandeep Singh Gill  
 
In his opening statement, Mr. Amandeep Gill thanked the government of Kenya and all participants 
for their continued partnership and openness to collaboration. He la id context for the engagement by 
referencing the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, where member states adopted a political 
declar ation with one of the key commitments being to improve digital cooperation i.e., work together 
across territorial boundaries and domains (government, civil society, academia, private sector , and the 
technology community) to address the MISUSE and the MISSE D-USE of digital technologies to 
drive progress on SDGs.  
He cited the example of M-pesa (Mobile Money) in Kenya and Mpesa -like solutions in the African 
region as empowering digital technologies that allow all people to participate in a modern economy. 
He noted that while stakeholders seek to address the misuse of digital technologies it is important to 
highlight such opportunities that promote the  realisation of the SDGs ensuring no one is left behind.  
7 The UN Envoy on Technology stated that the GDC is a unique, once -in-a-generation opportunity to 
reboot multilateralism at the Summit of the Future scheduled for 2024.  He highlighted that the GDC 
would be an opportunity to agree on some shared principles for an open, free and inclusive digital 
future. He emphasised the need to move from principle to action and that the GDC is the foundational 
pillar to drive said action.  
He noted that a key stream in the GDC was to address the digital divide. Over the two days, all 
participants would have an opportunity to articulate  what  an open, free and secure digital future for 
all, means. He further noted the importance of protecting both online and offline human rights and the 
significance of aligning technology with human rights.  
He encouraged the stakeholders to aim the conversation towards actionable solutions that bring value 
to member states. He challenged the audience to assess the ambition of the GDC and el evate the 
conversation to a level for leaders to listen to and find the political centre of the GDC and ensure it 
reflects the aspirations of Africa and its people, it  is relevan t to the diverse contexts, and evaluate how 
it could leverage existing opportu nities without leaving anyone behind.  
In his closing remarks, he assured the stakeholders that he is present to listen, learn and share and 
thanked the organisers  and GIZ for facilitating the consultations.  
 
3.2 Eng. Daniel O. Obam, Communications Secretary at  National Communications 
Secretariat) Representing Mr. Edwin Owalo the Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of 
Information, Communications and The Digital Economy, Republic of Kenya.  
 
Eng. Obam commenced his remarks by welcoming all participants to Kenya and thanki ng the 
organisers for facilitating the event. He noted that the government of Kenya was undergoing 
administrative transitions and conveyed  apologies on behalf of the Cabinet Secretary who was 
attending a different meeting to onboard the newly appointed Pri ncipal Secretaries.  
He then proceeded to read the address on behalf of the Cabinet Secretary:  
The Cabinet secretary expressed his gratitude that Kenya was among the three countries nominated to 
co-host the GDC consultations and reiterated that the country fully supports the UN report, “Our 
Common Agenda” and is in concurrence with all the 12 Commitments made therein, as they are 
aligned to the development agenda of the Government of Kenya.  
He noted that the aim of the GDC to connect all people, is very muc h in line with the commitment of 
the Government of Kenya to avail universal broadband to its citizens . In this regard, he indicated that 
to fast -track broadband connectivity across the country , the government has already committed to the 
construction of an  extra 100,000 kilometres of national fibre optic cable network. He stated that it 
aims to enhance government service delivery through the digitalization of all critical government 
processes and aims to make available 80% of services online in the next yea r. 
The CS noted that when improperly used, digital technologies can fuel divisions within and between 
countries, increase insecurity, undermine human rights, and exacerbate inequality therefore urged the 
full potential for beneficial use of technology, add ressing digital trust and security, must continue to 
be a priority.  
He stated that Kenya has developed robust and dynamic policy, legal and regulatory frameworks to 
support and promote digital inclusion and a sustainable digital economy and its ’ nomination  to host 
this vibrant digital consultation is a strong testament to the strides made in the digital space. He 
reported that the digitalisation of government services, digital business, infrastructure, innovation -
8 driven entrepreneurship, digital skills and digital inclusion, as well as creating awareness of data 
protection are among the fundamental pillars the country has identified as drivers for digital 
transformation.  
In his closing remarks, Eng. Obam thanked the Federal Government of Germany, as well as other 
partners, for committing to support and facilitate a cross -regional multi -stakeholder process in close 
coordination with the Office of the UN Secretary General’s Envoy on Technology. He reiterated 
Kenya’s commitment  to play its role as a trusted memb er of the United Nations.  
3.3 German Ambassador to Kenya, Mr. Sebastian Groth  
In his remarks, Amb. Groth  welcomed all in attendance and thanked the organisers and partners for 
bringing the event to fruition. He noted that the Global Digital Compact was a timely and crucial 
initiative hence the German government took it seriously from the beginning. He thanke d the 
Government of Kenya as well as the Principal Secretary of Foreign Affairs who were instrumental in 
the preparation of the conference. He acknowledged that Nairobi is one of the global digital 
technology hubs and that such initiatives create an opport unity for most countries in the North, 
including Germany, to engage, share and learn about innovation from the African continent at large.  
He reiterated that the Global Digital Compact project is a core element of the United Nations' 
common agenda as its m embers prepare for the next political. The GDC provides a roadmap for 
digital cooperation as it seeks to bring all stakeholders including governments, civil society, 
academia, the private sector, etc, together to see what role digital technology can play i n advancing 
sustainable development.  
He explained that the objective of the Africa consultations was to bring together all stakeholders  to 
examine  how the future of the GDC can facilitate the use of digital technologies for the realisation of 
the SDGs amid st the existing challenges and also explore how digital solutions could increase benefit 
and create opportunities for people in the global south. The consultations would further explore and 
identify the risk s and challenges associated with digital technolo gies including human rights and 
cybersecurity.  
Amb. Groth stated that alongside Kenya, the Federal Republic of Germany shall also be partnering 
with Mexico, and India as partners for the GDC consultations in the Americas and Asia  regions  
respectively. He c ommended Nairobi for being open and accommodating to digital technology and 
innovation and encouraged the continued building of expertise and leveraging on the existing  
opportunities.  
He concluded by stating that in the GDC consultations, the priority for Germany is not development 
cooperation but to initiate a political conversation - “how do we shape the digital future? How do we 
develop the next digital cycle?”  
4 Introduction and Orientation  
4.1 Getting to know the participants – Who is in the room?  
 
After the  welcoming speeches, the moderators explored, together with the participants, ‘who is in the 
room’ today. By raising their hand, each person responded to the following questions:  
Which sector or group are you / is your organisation representing?  
● Governments

4.2 Summary of open discourse -What does the digital future look like for Africa?  
Once the question about ‘Who is in the room had been answered, participants were invited to inquire 
from the person sitting next to them, and vice versa  on, ‘what a digital future looks like for Africa?’ 
Here is a sample of responses from the participants:  
● “The future is bright and promising with the potential leverage developments we’ve seen from 
other countries to leapfrog our progress. However, there are challenges on the nexus between 
rural and urban connectivity that needs to be addressed” - Government representative, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Kenya.  
● “The future is very bright with even more growth potential.” - Civil Society Representative, 
Nigeria.  
● “The future offers an opportunity for collaboration, particularly for African -grown solution s and 
not band -aid solutions copy pasted from the West. There’s potential; for multi -stakeholder 
collaboration and ensuring Africa is connected to the next industrial revolution.” - United Nations 
Agency Representative.  
● “There’s a need to understand and res pect the context. The future also offers opportunities for 
partnership and collaboration across public and private sectors for the public good.” - Technology 
and Innovation Hub Representative, Rwanda.

and rural sectors in entrench ing human rights and access to the internet.” - Ministry of ICT 
Representative, Benin.  
 
10 4.3 Anonymous survey  
Following the presentations, the moderators shared a link and QR -code ( here) to access an anony mous 
survey which contained the following questions:  
● Which country do you represent, today?  
● To which degree do you see the internet in your country open, free, and secure?  (On a scale from 
1 - 10) 
● What would it take to make the internet more open, free, an d secure in your country?  
● What is your main expectation from the 2 days of consultation?  
 
Findings from the survey are annexed herein and marked  ‘Annex 1.’ 
5 Lightning Talk - Perspectives from Civil Society  
To prepare for the subsequent discussions,  Ms Nnenna Nwakanma was invited to present a Civil 
Society perspective on the Global Digital Compact process and its context.  
5.1 Ms Nnenna Nwakanma, Chief Web Advocate at webfoundation.org  
Ms Nnenna provided an overview of her experience in the l ast 20 years in the digital space since the 
establishment of the digital solidarity fund and how over the years they have worked in Africa, to 
support the power of ICT for human development. She reiterated her confidence in the UN Tech 
Envoy Amandeep Gill Singh, based on his extensive experience and appreciated his openness to a 
multi -stakeholder approach, which is crucial to the process.  
On CSO engagement, she reported that the Web Foundation convenes  a forum of  about a hundred 
organisations interested in digital cooperation and invited all other CSOs who had mutual interests to 
join the platform. She noted that it is crucial for civil society to support the government in the GDC 
journey through collaboration and cooperation.  
She encouraged African countri es and all stakeholders to not only limit themselves to regional 
international consultations but also conduct similar consultations at national, sub -national, sectoral, 
and thematic levels. She shared that the Web Foundation held consultations in Ghana, Cô te d'Ivoire, 
UAE, Rwanda and Burkina Faso, among a broad base of stakeholders regarding the GDC. She called 
upon everyone to make use of the extensive resources for conducting consultations that have been 
developed and availed on the UN Secretary General’s  Envoy on the Technology’s website for the 
GDC.  
She cited her concerns about the sustainability of the consultation process and the importance of 
ensuring this is not a one -time event. She noted that this can only be achieved if all stakeholders agree 
to meaningfully engage in the GDC by being intentional and proactive from the consultative process 
and throughout the implementation process after it is adopted in 2024.  
She further shared her apprehension concerning the implementation of the GDC in a manner that 
ensures it serves the people as intended. Notably, member states may adopt the GDC with little or no 
sustainable actionable plan to implement it. She expressed concerns from her repeated trauma of 
engaging in similar processes e.g., the Digital Solida rity Fund as well as the Global and International 
Internet Governance Forums (IGFs) which despite being active have not yielded concrete policy 
solutions. Additionally, she noted that t he office of the UN Tech envoy, despite its competent 
leadership, is a quasi -judicial office without the capacity or mandate to implement the Africa 
development agenda under the GDC.  
Lastly, she thanked the German Government for its initiative and internationality in supporting the 
GDC process.  
11 4.2.1 Summary of Questions, Answer an d Feedback Session  
a. In developing the technology, we need, who will fund the capacity and how do we ensure that 
in the continent, we have the people to develop the technology as needed? (Academia, 
Senegal).  
Feedback: The DiploFoundation has for instance, been undertaking initiatives to ensure Africans are 
meaningfully included in digital spaces, strengthen ing African voices in digital diplomacy and spaces 
and provide online open resources that enhance the capacity for the meaningful participa tion of 
Africans. (DiploFoundation Representative, Kenya).  
b. What happened to the digital solidarity fund, is it achieving its initial objectives? African 
solutions should come from Africa. What is the best way to meaningfully engage African 
countries to ens ure robust, inclusive, and meaningful engagements? (Government, Kenya)  
 
Answer by Ms.Nnenna  
Forums like the IGF are important because the discussions lead to action. Engagements on the 
sidelines of such events have been quite meaningful. Thematic, regional and community -based 
working groups are meaningful and efficient as they give precise actions and recommendation s and 
they should therefore be encouraged.  
In conclusion, Ms. Nnenna emphasised the need for capacity building to address challenges and poor 
decision -making that is mostly based on ignorance such as internet shutdowns based on  impunity and 
emotional respo nses without proper consideration of the bigger picture.  
She noted that a good place to start is reflecting on what we have in our own countries, and how we 
can make the best of it. For instance, Kenya n IGF could be a platform to make decisions, and 
imple ment them, cross -fertilise our expertise and share experiences with other African countries. 
Government should not fear new technology rather it should be open and willing to try these 
innovations and initiatives.  
5 Sustainable Use of Digital Technologies in  the 21st Century: 
Achieving the 2030 Agenda and Strengthening Human Rights 
(Presentation of practical experiences about how digital 
technologies helped achieve SDGs in Africa)  
 
After the lightning talk, the core of the 2 -day consultation session commenced : The exchange 
alongside three major topics, namely  
● Sustainable Use of Digital Technologies in the 21st Century: Achieving the 2030 Agenda 
and Strengthening Human Rights,  
● Protecting a global, open, free and secure Internet: Addressing the Risk of Internet  
Fragmentation and Reinforcing the Multi -Stakeholder Model,  
● Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies: Advancing Technological Innovation 
and Protecting Human Rights  
During these sessions, participants were able to  
1. Receive an initial input linke d to the topic in question, followed by a short Q&A  
2. Take part in an exchange in breakout groups. Based on guiding questions, these moderated 
group  sessions  discussed and worked out aspects linked to the topic, documented them on a 
digital board and formula ted key messages as a summary of what should be included and 
12 considered in the  GDC process. All groups discussed the same topic and the same guiding 
questions in parallel.  
3. Finally each group s hare their results and key messages in the plenary  session.  
5.2 Ms R ym Jarou, Unit Manager - Technology Driven Entrepreneurship, Smart 
Africa Alliance  
o Why do we need a single digital market in Africa?  
Ms. Jarou started by elaborating that Africa's digital economy  is projected  to be worth  US$180B by 
2025 and that so far, the continent has the fastest -growing urban, mobile population. Consequently, 
both people and businesses could benefit from a single digital market through trade and commerce, 
innovation, diversity in investments and improved quality of life through t echnology  
Nonetheless, she noted, there are significant barriers to unlocking this potential. For instance, the 
continent has over 50 countries  with over 50 digital legal, regulations and policies and there are  
limited cross -countries infrastructures and the continent still relies strongly on non -African 
infrastructure and products. Additionally, there’s a low level of digital skill  (data available for a few 
countries in Africa shows an average of 8% in the standard literacy skills) and  digital markets are 
largely national and do not benefit from the scale of the continent.  
She explained that Smart Africa aims to unlock Africa’s potential by transforming the continent into a 
Single Digital Market by 2030, through a bold and innovative mu lti-stakeholder approach. She added 
that the Smart Africa Manifesto was endorsed by Heads of State and Government in October 2013 
and further endorsed by the AU in January 2014. The principles therein include;  
1. To put ICT at the centre of national socioecon omic development agenda  
2. To improve access to ICT , especially Broadband  
3. To improve accountability, efficiency and openness through ICT  
4. To put the Private Sector First  
5. To leverage ICT to promote sustainable development  
So far, the Smart Africa Alliance h as grown to 35 member states representing approximately 
1.1billion people as well as development partners in the private sector, NGOs and academia. In 
moving forward, she stated that they aim to drive more impact with their new Triennial strategy 2023 -
2025 , driven by three major programmes Sustainable & inclusive digital infrastructure (CONNECT),  
Digital Empowerment and Capacity Building (INNOVATE) and Digital transformation & Services 
(TRANSFORM). She concluded by reiterating that the core of the work is c ross-border collaboration 
and in -country support.  
5.2.1 Summary of Questions, Answer and Feedback Session  
Questions posed:  
a. On the implementation of connectivity cross border  programmes; Kenya has multiple projects 
aiming at achieving this - how do you leverage the pre -existing programme to ensure they are 
in tandem and have no duplication (Government representative from Kenya  
b. Is Smart Africa operating under the aegis of another institution? What are the s pecific 
activities implemented by smart Africa?  
c. Initially t he goal was for Smart Africa to be the equivalent of the digital arm of the African 
Union, is that still the goal?  
d. What’s the progress in allowing for network roaming i.e access to digital services freely 
across African borders?  
e. How specific is the engagement of Smart Africa in each country? What’s the nature of the 
engagement and how is it structured?  
13 Ms. Rym Jarou’s R esponse:  
Smart Africa is trying to support countries with their digital infrastructure development and support 
interconnectivity between countries. Africa's backbone project seeks to connect at least three countries 
to have shared connectivity and then bu ild the interconnectivity from there.  
Smart Africa’s manifesto (anchoring document) was endorsed by the AU, they are co -chairs and 
partners in the implementation. Smart Africa is thus not an institution under the AU but has a close 
relationship  of coopera tion with the AU.  
Engagements in different countries take various models e.g development of blueprints or policies that 
can be utilised by the countries or the implementation of a concrete digital project in the country e.g 
the smart cities in Rwanda. Eff orts towards the creation of a One Africa network are still ongoing, and 
the ambition is still alive and the enthusiasm, but the implementation is not easy, and it is therefore 
still a work in progress.  
Other strategies include the development of guiding blue prints e.g. Tunisia started with specific start -
ups and led the work on the blueprint for the continent. Each country has agency on their key areas of 
focus based on the maturity of its ecosystems. At Smart Africa, after developing the blueprint, we 
gather all relevant continental stakeholders to review the blueprint to ensure that regardless of your 
digital ecosystem, one still has a roadmap to strengthen and advance their digital policies , that is, 
continental tools for policies and strategies that ca n be contextualised to specific needs/countries from 
alliance level to country levels.

5.3 Ms Angela Lungati, Executive Director at Ushahidi & Civic Tech Frontrunner  
In her introduction, Ms. Lungati  observed that digital platforms are equivalent to fertile land as they 
represent opportunities. Ordinary citizens must be included as part of the issues and seeking solutions 
for their issues, solutions should tap into the collective intelligence and agen cies of the people that are 
impacted.  
The Ushahidi platform was born out of the 2007/08 post -election violence when a group of 5 bloggers 
at the time decided to create a platform for ordinary people to share what was happening around them 
that was not bei ng reported by the mainstream media.   
Ushahidi is intentional in shaping solutions by providing a global platform of integrated tools and 
services. The platform is free and open source, cost -effective and available. It is accessible and usable 
on readily available solutions e.g., phones. The platform also allows people to engage in local 
languages that they are familiar with. In a bottom -up approach to information sharing, citizens are 
more actively involved in actions that affect them and take collective responsibility.   
Some examples of how the Ushahidi platform has been applied in advancing SDGs are:  
a. Activists in Egypt have used the platform to monitor sexual harassment against women by 
plotting harass maps to create awareness and drive community -based interventions and create 
a shift in mindset on  the issue of  sexual harassment . 
 
b. In every election in Kenya since 2008 , the platform has been deployed to empower  citizens to 
protect their vote and ensure a fair outcome , by sharing  informatio n on potential incidents 
which are then channelled to the relevant authorities for a response as a preventative measure. 
The platform will also be used in the upcoming elections in Nigeria in 2023.  
 
c. Documenting the effects of climate change and collecting  climate data, the voice of people in 
Kenya. The platform has been  deployed in the Tana River Climate Change & Livelihoods 
14 Restoration Project to document  citizens' experiences  on the impact of climate change and use 
said information to help leaders and go vernments create solutions.  
In conclusion, Ms. Lungati urged stakeholders to look at practical ways of creating inclusion of 
citizens beyond the boardroom.  
5.3.1 Summary of Questions, Answer and Feedback Session  
Questions posed:  
a. How do other countries/stakeholders access or use the Ushahidi platform?  
b. How can we bring in more private sector players in ICT to support similar initiatives and 
develop open -source systems? (Government representative from Malawi)?  
c. How many languages are used in the Ushahidi platform? In the African context countries 
have more than 1000 languages, to what extent are translations feasible?  
Ms. Lungati’s response: There are two ways to use the platform. Firstly, you can download the 
software, take source code and custo mise it to your needs or use Ushahidi as a host by registering 
directly on their website. The platform is open in any country. For translations , where certain tools are 
only available in  specific languages such as  Swahili, a plug -in can , for instance,  be used to aid 
translation.  
In conclusion, Ms. Lungati challenged those who  utilise tech-based platforms and use existing open 
software to explore ways of adding value through collaborations with the private sector to enhance 
capacity and security.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15 6 Breakout Session 1: Sustainable Use of Digital Technologies in the 21st Century  
After the initial presentations and Q&As, the discussion in the breakout groups started, based on the following guiding questions and methodological notes:  
o Where are we standing regarding SDGs globally and in Africa?  
o How did the use of digital technologies already contribute to addressing the issue(s) and how can it contribute even further?  
o Which contribution is necessary f rom each stakeholder to make digital technologies a strong driver for achieving the 2030 Agenda?  
● Please mark what opinions/aspects are disputed within the group!  
● Which opinions/aspects resonate most within the group?  
● Formulate 2 - 5 key messages!  
Group 1  6.2 Where are we standing regarding SDGs 
globally and in Africa?  6.3 How did the use of digital 
technologies already 
contribute to addressing 
the issue(s) and how can it 
contribute even further?  6.4 Which contribution is 
necessary from each 
stakeholder to make  digital 
technologies a strong 
driver for achieving the 
2030 Agenda?  
 Controversial Opinion - Realistically, achieving the 2030 
Agenda on SDG is impossible by 2030  
 
● SDG 3 and 4 performances in Nigeria have been 
deprioritised over time and implementation is 
abysmal  
● Zambia has seen progress in SDG 4 with the 
implementation of free education under the new 
administration, quality and standards of 
education, however, need to be improved. There 
are opportunities to leverage technology to 
address many gaps in addressing the quality of 
education  ● In Rwanda, digital 
technology has been used in 
enhancing service delivery 
for citizens, focusing on 
ensuring access to digital 
services for ALL citizens  
● Legal vis a vis digital 
identity - centring digital 
identity as a basis for service 
delivery excludes 
marginalised populations. 
Human rights impact sho uld 
be the foundation of ● Invest in the safety and 
protection of sustainable 
digital infrastructure  
● Goal 17-Reassess the nature 
of public -private partnerships 
beyond economic 
interventions, e.g., 
collaborations based on 
social, cultural and economic  
development  
● Human Rights and Digital 
literacy - review approach in 
deploying digital tech in 
16 ● In Kenya SDG 17 - Partnership for the goals has 
been exemplary due to multi -stakeholder 
collaboration  
● In Tunisia - SDGs 2, 3, and 4 are a little bit on 
track.  
● In Kenya - SDG 16, digital inclusion is 
progressive , but aspects of human rights are not 
included in implementing digital responses, and 
marginalised communities are still being left 
behind. Human rights need to be at the centre of 
implementing SDG 16. An emerging contrary 
opinion was that the adoption of digital 
technologies in SDGs sought to improve 
efficiency and enhance service delivery.  
● In Cameroon - The legal framework on ICT is 
sufficient, the current focus is to improve 
universal access and coverage and integrate ICT 
in education (SDG4)  
● In Egypt - embracing technology/adoption of 
digital services in implementing SDGs is below 
average by the government due to a lack of 
investment and access. For CSO - no coordinated 
leadership, minimal investment, and awareness 
are still lacking  
● On SDG 10 and 9, Ghana h as done well 
regionally, and digital integration and adoption 
have improved. Mobile money has been 
instrumental in advancing sustainable 
development  
● In Malawi, there is good progress on SDG 5 in 
advancing Sexual Reproductive Health Rights 
and addressing gender parity in participation in 
governance on SDG7 - Inclusion of solar power 
to the national grid and on SDG9 - Lots of digitisation in service 
delivery.  
● Use of ATI in fact -checking 
information/data provided 
by governments, centring 
citizen agencies and voices 
in assessing the impact of 
digital technologies.  
● Access to digital 
infrastructure (SDG 8) has 
improved access to decent 
work through virtual 
learning, creating job 
opportunities and improving 
well-being and financial 
opportunities.  
● Inclusive internet - 
MEANINGFULLY include 
critical populations to avoid 
some being left behind e.g., 
women, PWDs, a nd children 
in deploying digital 
technologies  
● Democratise access to digital 
technologies - ensure digital 
technologies is not elitist, 
cheap, quality, and 
accessible tech for all  
 service delivery,  create more 
awareness for HR  
● Content moderation - mitigate 
information disorder (mis and 
disinformation) to ensure 
information integrity  
● Trust and accountability at the 
centre of digital technologies  
● Inclusive policy development  
● Assess the capacity to adopt 
and implement technologies 
being developed  
● Push for the adoption of 
regional and international 
frameworks on tech and 
ensure structured coordination  
● Address the cost of digital 
technology  
 
17 investment in ICT infrastructure but there is a 
need for data protection legislation  
 
Key Messages  i. Africa is not just a ma rket- respect the agency, input and contribution of the continent  
j. Meaningful inclusi on of ALL populations (women, children, PWDs, etc.)  
k. Centre human rights at the core of digital technology services  
l. Make digital technologies affordable, accessible and of g ood quality - ensure GDC is not elitist  
m. Make the digital environment safe and secure for all  
 
 
 
Group 2  Where are we standing regarding 
SDGs globally and in Africa?  How did the use of digital technologies 
already contribute to addressing the 
issue(s) and how can it contribute even 
further?  Which contribution is necessary 
from each stakeholder to make 
digital technologies a strong 
driver for achieving the 2030 
Agenda?  
 Mutual Opinion - We are not on track; 
from the perspective of the key pillars -
environmental,  social, and economic  
● The realities exposed by the Covid -
19 pandemic include the digital 
divide, and the question remains 
whether the SDGs reflect our 
contextual realities.  
● Generally, we are not on track as 
issues such as corruption , poor 
project design, and lack of buy -in 
by local populations across 
different countries are derailing the 
sustainability of programs e.g., the ● To facilitate people's participation and 
inclusion e.g., use of online tools such as 
the UNSG Envoy on Technology survey 
tool to submit feedback on GDC  
● Government digital platforms: enhancing 
transparency in procurement and 
payments, enabling the provision  of govt 
services e.g., Kenya's Huduma  centres - 
centralised government services  
● The other side of digital tools. e.g., the use 
of digital lending platforms to drive 
access to finances but possibly silently 
catalysing poverty amongst certain Controversial opinion - Private -public 
sector cooperation; addressing certain 
challenges e.g. to facilitate access, 
there is a shared responsibility 
obligation towards the attainment of 
SDGs; between the private sector 
(may provide resources) and 
governments (enabling environment)  
 
Mutual Opinion - Governments need 
to play their role in addressing the 
gaps in infrastructure, access, 
connectivity and digita l literacy  
 
18 Siaya irrigation programme (SDG 
1 & 2) in Kenya.  
● Regarding the digital space there 
are challenges such as impor tation 
of data laws that cannot necessarily 
be implemented in the African 
context e.g., GDPR; consideration 
of the people affected by the digital 
interventions e.g., PWDs, questions 
about identity vs identification in 
the era of digital ID systems, lack 
of meaningful consultations.  
● It is not all doom and gloom; as 
SDGs are well communicated; 
most people know about them but 
we need to work on their 
implementation.  
 
 populations who  use the platforms without 
full knowledge of their implications  
● Enhancing research on i nterventions  such 
as renewable energy solutions such as 
solar  
● Open data sources such as Ushahidi, and 
UNICEF Tool -Rapid pro - provide 
feedback platform s where citizens ca n 
voice concerns and policymakers/ govt 
can respond  
● Use tools to a ddress specific challenges 
affecting specific populations e.g., 
enhancing awareness of children's 
vaccination programmes  
● Enhancing citizen participation e.g UN 
General Assembly global citize ns' 
assembly utilised  online platforms 
alongside localised  support to bridge the 
digital divide to bring citizens together 
and deliberate on the climate crisis  
● Use of emerging technologies in 
the implementation of projects that would 
otherwise not be plaus ible; Drone projects 
in Namibia in the agriculture sector  to 
monitor and respond to specific 
challenges  
 ● Governments; Assembling the 
different solutions and 
ensuring access  
● Government; to develop Open 
Data policy in Africa; to 
facilitate innovation  
● All stakeholders; 
contributions to capacity 
building  
● Private sector; to upscale 
skills and experience gaps in 
the formal education system  
● Need to harmonise 
interventions! Bring resources 
and initiatives together 
(declaration for the future of 
the internet, ROAM -X 
indicators, etc)  
 
 
19 Key Messages   
a. People engagement is critical to ensure context -responsive solutions, the inclusion of specific groups; youth, women  
b. Government and private sector collaboration is necessary to address the power imbalance issue  
c. Consideration of  the African context and time line as far as the achievement of SDGs is concerned  
d. Capacity building is necessary for legislators and the general population  
e. Technology has to be paired with enabling policy e.g., Open data policy + proactive government

e. Taking the environmental impacts of digital technology  into consideration  
 
21 7 Protecting a global, open, free and secure Internet  
 
Just like the first topic, the second topic was introduced by a  presentation  followed by a short Q&A. 
Later, the participants split up into the same groups as before, worked on the guiding questions and 
formulated key messages. The results and key messages were then shared in the plenary.  
7.2 Addr essing the Risk of Internet Fragmentation and Reinforcing the Multi -
Stakeholder Model - Josephine Miliza , Africa Regional Coordinator, Association 
of Progressive Communication - LOCNET Project hosted by KICTANET  
 
Ms. Miliza acknowledged that the topic of in ternet fragmentation has been discussed for some time, 
but recent conversations have focused on digital sovereignty and the global control of the internet. 
These discussions are happening at legislative and regulatory levels, with the stated goal of protec ting 
the end user. However, these efforts are seen as threatening the original concept of an open, 
interconnected and interoperable internet.  
She explained that the Policy Network on Internet Fragmentation is a multi -stakeholder coalition that 
aims to rai se awareness about measures and actions that pose a risk to an open internet. The group has 
identified three key areas of fragmentation: the user experience, the technical layer, and internet 
governance and coordination. It brings together a group of 28 st akeholders from the industry 
including civil society organisations. They issued a joint statement raising concerns about the human 
risks of internet fragmentation and setting out principles for an open, interconnected, and 
interoperable internet. These pri nciples include protecting and promoting human rights, the open and 
interconnected nature of the internet, and the global free flow of information. The group also 
advocates for efforts to address the root causes of internet fragmentation, promote cooperati on to 
increase trust in the internet, and commit to preserving and strengthening the multi -stakeholder model 
of internet governance.  
7.1.2 Summary of Questions, Answer and Feedback Session  
 
Questions Posed  
a. Who are the members of the Public Policy implementation on Internet Governance - all 
stakeholders within the IGF network?  
b. What are the accountability structures in place for internet fragmentation?  
Opinion : Internet fragmentation can work at the national l evel, while we work with the envoy at the 
UN level, local actors could start working on local policy actions e.g. when Nigeria blocked Twitter, 
citizens downloaded VPNs using US and UN servers which affected algorithms. (Civil Society 
Representative, Côte d'Ivoire).  
c. Digital dignity - Why are African countries not adopting e -visas?  
d. Why is the internet so expensive in Africa?  
Response from Ms Josephine Miliza  
● Membership is open to everyone -I think all stakeholders who are within the IGF framework  
● There is no accountability framework yet. Currently, there is no common understanding of 
what internet fragmentation is and what it is not. This is why discussions through the Policy 
Network or other coalitions, especially at national and regional levels, are important. Without 
accountability frameworks, views on fragmentation are very divergent.
22 8 Breakout Session: Protecting a global, open, free, and secure Internet  
The participants were divided into the same 3 groups and started the discussion based on these guiding questions and methodological notes:  
o What are the main risks for an open, free and secure Internet from an African perspective?  
o Which measures are necessary?  
o How can GDC contribute to addressing the issue?  
o How can an inclusive vision for the f uture of the Internet look like?

an open, free and secure 
Internet from an African 
perspective?  8.2 Which measures are 
necessary?  8.3 How can GDC 
contribute to 
addressing the 
issue?  8.4 How can an 
inclusive 
vision for the 
future 
Internet look 
like?  
 ● Lack of technical 
understanding from decision -
makers  
● Adoption of insecure solutions 
exposes the continent to 
attacks  
● Africa is not well represented 
at the international level at 
decision -making forums  
● Geo-political power play 
(Ukraine vs Russia)  ● Increase 
capacity/competen cies 
in countries (gov, 
technical, users, etc.)  
● Data protection 
(confidentiality and 
integrity)  
● Better cybersecurity  
● Better cyber regulations  
● Cyber -cooperation 
between countries (build ● Make sure that 
African countries

decision table and 
that it is heard!  
● Make sure that the 
private sector ● The 
consideratio n 
that users are 
not only 
consumers.... 
they are 
humans  
 
23 ● Adoption without adaption? 
exposes users (specifically to 
regulations)  
● Cybe r criminality which 
pushes countries to shutdown  
● Digital economy: Africa is a 
consumer and not a producer 
(digital colonisation) our  data 
is being exploited  
● Africa should not be the only 
"open": inequality/imbalance 
in relations  
 a framework for 
information sharing)  
● Adapt civil laws to new 
cyber -environment and 
educate actors  
● Create cybersecurity 
agencies and make them 
functional  
● Take into account local 
socio -economic -political 
context (must be locally 
rooted)  
 actions do not 
contribute to more 
fragmentation of 
the internet.... or 
do not create a 
new gap between 
users (cyber -
discrimination ) 
 
Key Messages  g. Better clarity on the notions of digital privacy/rights, and internet openness  
h. Digital inequalities are a reflection of existing non -digital ones: reinforce systematically the African voice.  
i. Awareness, education, follow -up, etc... knowledge building.  
 
 
Group 2  What are the main 
risks for an open, free 
and secure Internet 
from an African 
perspective?  Which measures are necessary?  How can GDC 
contribute to 
addressing the 
issue?  How can an 
inclusive 
vision for 
the future 
Internet 
look like?  
 ● Internet 
shutdowns  
● Technoference; 
and its social 
impact on Mutual Opinion - Enhancing Access: Infrastructure sharing, a 
regulatory framework that addresses silos in certain sectors, 
private and public sector actors - Could GDC for instance 
include principles on infrastructure sharing to address 
emerging challenges such as resistance?  
 ● Opportunities  
in low -tech 
solutions as 
well 
● Set out 
principles on Null 
24 children, and the 
population  
● Effective policy 
and an 
understanding of 
the 
implementation of 
the policies from 
the consumers’ 
perspective as 
well as at 
enforcement by 
the investigators 
/prosecutors/ 
judicial officers  
● Risks to children; 
cyberbullying, 
exploitation, and 
the need to 
consider their 
opinions  
● Misinformation 
and 
disinformation  
● Neo-colonialism 
elements; Africa  
as a recipient of 
tech solutions/ 
models, how do 
we bridge the 
gaps 
● Cybersecurity 
risks  
 ● Platforms that open conversations to varieties of 
stakeholders; including citizens,  
● Capacity building/ awareness on the internet risks, 
and cybers ecurity to help counter some of these 
challenges  
● Specific initiatives for marginalised groups such as 
women, and girls and also encourage creative use.  
● Sensitisation on the need for responsible use of the 
internet; expand the training curriculums to subjects 
such as cyberpsychology  
● Collaborative efforts between regulating bodies e.g., 
ODC Kenya cannot enforce against digital lending 
platforms without registration regulation by CBK  
● Affordable internet; Kenya government initiatives 
such a s fibre optic infrastructure expansion; fair 
competition in the sector, One Area Network, 
investment mindset based on the centrality of the 
need for the internet as an enabler of the economy, 
addressing corruption e.g., Côte d'Ivoire the law 
allows the use  of electric poles to expand fibre 
connectivity -but only certain companies are given 
exclusive use  
● Regulations that govern some of the challenges e.g., 
internet shutdowns  
● African governments: expand participation of 
stakeholders in standard setting/making forums to 
enhance engagement of academia, and private sectors 
as seen in other countries such as China  
● Human rights -centred regulatory frameworks  
● Institutionalise public participation as a mechanism to

Following the conclusion of the plenary discussion , the 1st day was officially closed by the moderators. Later, the participants met for a joint dinner and 
networking session in the hotel.
27 9 INTRODUCTION TO DAY 2  
9.1 Opening remarks, Mr. Yves Iradukunda -Permanent Secretary Ministry of ICT 
and Innovations in Rwanda  
The day began with an address by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of ICT and Innovation in 
Rwanda, who noted that there was a lot of work to be done t owards ensuring that the GDC 
interventions reflect the needs of those impacted particularly in the African context as had arisen in 
the discussions from Day 1.  
He also noted that they will be conducting national -level consultations in Rwanda to ensure that  more 
stakeholders contribute to the outcome of the GDC. He finished by observing that the development of 
the GDC would require collective effort toward supporting the UNSG’s Envoy on Technology, 
Under -Secretary -General.  
9.2 Feedback on the anonymous survey co nducted on Day 1  
Martin Reinfeldt presented the results from the anonymous survey, annexed herein and marked in 
Annex 1  
9.3 Recap from Day 1  
Participants were invited to share their key takeaways from the Day 1 discussions. The key emerging 
observations were:  
i. It was critical to note the impact of the conversations arising from the consultations and 
ensure that the consultations are carried on to national consultations at the country level.  
ii. There were wonderful stories about the digital landscape in the contine nt as told through the 
discussions so far. However, it was imperative that the various challenges and aspirations be 
in contact with our realities and as the participants represent various stakeholders, they had a 
responsibility to impact change through th e conversations from day 1.  
iii. The opening speeches enriched the conversations but the presentation by Ushahidi, on the 
open data source platform really struck a chord  as it presented a solution that could possibly 
be implemented to meet direct user needs.  
iv.  Increasing accessibility while enhancing security were two important issues for Africa . 
v. The emerging issues are shared across different countries and thus the GDC co nsultations 
should be elevated to regional and continental platforms.  
vi. Africa is not looking to impose, gain superiority or dominate in the digital space rather it is 
clear that Africa wants to develop and be able to meet the needs of its people and their w ell-
being, while still staying true to values such as community and being respectful of culture 
and diversity . 
vii. The capabilities of digital technologies to enhance production transformation is critical to the 
attainment of the SDGs.  
  
 
28 10 The impact of artificial intelligence and emerging 
technologies: advancing technological innovation and 
protecting human rights  
Following the same sequencing as in the previous two sessions , the discussion around artificial 
intelligence and emerging technologies started with 3 presentation.  In contrast to the other sessions , 
the inputs were not directly followed by the group work, but  by a Fishbowl Discussion which 
included the presenters on the one hand, but would also - on the other hand - give the opportunity to 
any other participant to directly engage in  the debate in the plenary.  
 
After the Fishbowl Discussion, the participants split into their breakout , worked on the various 
questions  and developed  key messages and then later presented them in the plenary.  
10.1 Presentation by Mr. Marco Kamiyo - United Nations Industrial Development 
Organisation (UNIDO)  
In his presentation, Mr. Kamiy o observed th at potential of digital technologies to improve is evident  
from the very technologies that we interact with on a daily basis such as google translate.  
Digital technologies and AI have demonstrated certain key benefits including improved productivity, 
lower operational costs, better decision -making, better product development and use in accelerating 
employees’ skills.  
On the other hand, these technologies also pose various challenges including the high cost of 
implementation, limi tations in skill capacities, infrastructural and standard gaps particularly in the 
developing world, gaps in private and public collaboration, and lack of basic infrastructure in certain 
areas.  
Mr. Kamiyo  also highlighted some projects around the World u tilising such technologie s to provide 
solutions  such as the Fisheries 4.0 Project in Indonesia which has enhanced the management in the 
fisheries and aquaculture sectors, strengthening implementation of the AI Eco System in Jordan to 
enhance urban planning , to create job opportunities, improve the efficiency of government services 
and enhance the social and economic development of different sectors.  
In Africa, Mr. Kamiyo highlighted  the first Creative Hub in Ethiopia equipped with various digital 
instrumen ts. In Côte d’Ivoire, there is the integration of 41R ecosystems to foster youth employment. 
Other examples cited are the use of blockchain and smart lenses in Ghana ’s Agricultur al sector, the 
use of the Internet of Things for geothermal energy in Kenya an d Namibia’s GIS imagery and AI 
based on satellites and drones in the sustainable processing of bushes that affect harvest by imaging in 
the fields  and identifying the affected areas that require interventions. He noted that such projects are 
implemented in  consultations with the farmers/ communities to ensure continuity and sustainability.  
In his recommendations on appropriate next steps; he noted the need to leverage on the global public 
goods of the emerging technologies such as open data, and open system s for the industry, the need to 
enhance training and skills and build a global alliance on AI for the industry , build regional and global 
networks amongst UN Agencies, Development Agencies and Development Banks and keep learning 
about Frontier Technologies  and AI effects on cybersecurity, jobs, youth and gender.   
29 10.2 Presentation by Mr. Jack Ngare, Technical Director in the Office of the Chief 
Technology Officer, Google Cloud  
Mr. Ngare observed that in most instances, technology amplifies things that happen in  society offline 
including the negative. While the role of various stakeholders such as government and civil society 
actors is well defined, the key question for further evaluation is the role of techies and corporations. 
For a start, he noted that the rol e of Africans in tech corporations is to amplify the voice of Africans in 
the development of technologies. He observed that Google has for instance been incorporating local 
languages across African countries such as Kinyarwanda, Amharic, and Kikuyu.  
Furthe r, he noted the potential of AI technologies to amplify the capabilities of the African Continent, 
while leveraging on Africa's demographic dividend of young people; considering the median age for 
Africa is 19, compared to countries like China with a media n age of 38 while that of India is 27. Thus 
60% of the workforce by 2030 will be in Africa, while Africa may not have been part of the industrial 
revolution as it were, we have the opportunity to be part of the technology revolution, which requires 
that th e continent upscales the skills of its population for them to fully engage.  
Mr. Ngare concluded his presentation by highlighting the 7 principles of Google on AI which are:  
1. Be socially beneficial: positively impact various fields be it healthcare, security, energy, etc 
while being respectful of the cultural norms in countries where they operate;  
2. Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias; 
3.  Be built and tested with safety in mind; continuously reviewed to respond to the evolving 
context;  
4. Be accountable to people; be subjected to the court of human beings and have an appeal 
mechanism;  
5. Incorporate privacy design principles;  
6. Uphold high standards of scientific excellence; and  
7. Be made available for uses that are in accord with the principles.  
10.3 Presentation by Ms. Linda Bonyo CEO, Africa Lawyers Hub  
In her introduction, Ms. Bonyo noted that it was imperative that a focus on the possibilities offered by 
AI technology includes a reflection on policy.  
Ms. Bonyo’s presentation was focused  on the AI legal landscape in Kenya. She observed that one of 
the main challenges in Kenya was the importation of policy without due regard for the context and 
without consideration of the opinions of the local professionals. This is of particular concern since 
some of the key drivers have certain interests in pushing certain ideas  to countries like Kenya. e.g the 
European interest in pushing its digital policies to the rest of the World and the American interest in 
pushing its emerging technologies across the World.  
Some of the key components in the AI landscape fall within 5 categories: AI infrastructure, AI 
Development Companies/Startups  or Communities, AI Governance, AI Advocacy, and AI Sectoral 
Use. While there are no definitive laws on AI in Kenya, aspects of it are alluded to in policies and 
provisions on digital technologies. There are also cross -cutting guiding principles emanating from the 
Constitution of Kenya such as Art 27 on equality and freedom of discrimination, rights to privacy (Art 
31), and freedom of expression (Art 33) among other rights. Relevant policy frameworks with an 
application to AI include the Digital Economy Blu ePrint, 2019, the Data Protection (General) 
Regulations, 2021, the National Broadband Strategy 2018 -2023 and the Kenya National Digital 
Master Plan 2022 -2032 among others.  
30 Notable Regional frameworks include the African Union Data Policy Framework and the Blue Print 
on AI for Africa. She observed that in general, the approach in most African countries is the 
criminalisation of cybersecurity issues with minimum focus on user protection. However, there are 
more progressive approaches in some North African Cou ntries such as Morocco and Egypt.  
In terms of international frameworks that could offer guidance on best practices, Ms. Bonyo 
highlighted the EU -AI Act, UNICEF Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, OECD 
AI Principles, America’s Blueprint  for AI Bill of Rights, and the EU General Data Protection 
Regulations (GDPR). In addition, Ms.  Bonyo highlighted some key regulatory considerations 
emerging from practices across various countries in handling AI such as the establishment of an AI 
expert A dvisory Group in Canada, the establishment of an independent AI oversight body in 
Singapore, the establishment of Research centres as seen in Morocco, application of AI in strategic 
sectors as seen in Mauritius’s National AI Strategy, encouraging public pa rticipation in AI as seen in 
UAE’s National Program for AI and Think AI Initiative, inter alia.  
In conclusion, therefore, Ms. Bonyo noted that there is a need for Kenya and Africa to stay ahead and 
avoid always being recipients of technology and also ensur e effective policy, institutional and legal 
frameworks for the application of AI, without necessarily just mirroring laws from other countries and 
regions without due regard for our context.  
11 Fishbowl Session  
Participants engaged in an insightful fishbowl s ession posing questions to the presenters and engaging 
in discourse on the issue at hand. Some of the key points arising from the session were:  
a. The need to bridge gaps in skills and understanding of law and tech; by addressing gaps in 
formal education but also paying specific attention to enforcement agencies including lawyers 
and the Judiciary to ensure they are well  informed as they determine issues touching on AI.  
 
b. The impact of data -based solutions that are informed by inclusive data subjects results  in 
flawed solutions that reinforce societal biases and exclusion.  
 
c. The absence of adequate policies and practices around data handling, sharing and storage 
particularly by private actors. However, Mr. Ngare  noted that principles around data are still a 
probl em even for the biggest organisations but it gets better with conscious efforts towards 
enhancing data sets to inform algorithms, while we cannot afford to wait for perfect data to 
develop and innovate, there is need to continue encouraging informed consent on the use and 
sharing of data for the greater good.  
 
d. Ms. Bonyo also observed that there is a need for efforts towards creating a balance between 
the rights to privacy for users and commercial use of data for certain benefits such as for 
research purposes. She also noted that there are challenges with the existence of monopolies 
of data amongst big ger corporations and thus the need to consider policies on the sharing of 
data with other stakeholders such as start -ups. She also observed that organisations such as 
the Lawyers Hub, are working towards developing model laws that could guide countries 
seeking to develop laws and further buttressed the need to enhance skills locally (Africa) to 
facilitate meaningful engagement.  
 
e. Mr. Kamiya reiterated the need to enhance indigenous capacity on the use of data, the 
integration of data sets to enhance producti vity, strengthening  the innovation ecosystems and 
the need to facilitate basic research needs in the developing world. 
31  
f. It is important to invest in research in African Universities as reinforced by the role of 
universities in the birth of existing global tech companies e.g., Google  born out of Stanford 
University, or Facebook which  began at Harvard University.  
 
g. The goal should not be the actualisation of data sovereignty but rather the potential to meet 
the needs of society for the greater good e.g., by us ing technology and data to enhance 
education for children on various platforms.  
 
h. There is a need  for proper principles on the capacity -building components and skills transfer 
in projects implemented in countries with lower skill capacities as well as coope ration 
between lawyers and tech experts to ensure responsive laws and policies.  
 
i. There is a need  for the African continent to work towards creating the Continent as one Trade 
Area even in the digital components to ensure more collaborative and collective a pproaches to 
issues affecting all countries including data and AI gaps, better bargaining power, lower costs 
and breakdown silos.  
 
j. Considerations for special groups particularly vulnerable groups such as children to ensure 
that their interests are adequately considered even though they are not part of such 
consultations in their own right. In this regard, it was noted that existing pr inciples such as the 
UNICEF  Principles on AI and Children  are an important reference point for such 
considerations.    
32 12 Break out session: on artificial intelligence and emerging technologies  
The participants entered three breakout sessions for discussions guided by the following questions:  
● Which opportunities and risks do AI and other emerging technologies offer?  
● How can they be regulated?  
● Who should be in charge of standard setting and regulation?  
● How can GDC contribute to addressing the issue?  
The groups were also invited to mark what opinions or aspects were disputed in the group and which resonated most within the group and also formulate 2 -5 
key messages from the discussion. Herein is a summary  of the responses to the guiding questions from the groups as also presented in the plenary session

do AI and other emerging 
technologies offer?  How can they be regulated?  
 Who should be in 
charge of standard 
setting and 
regulation?  
 How can GDC contribute to 
addressing the issue?   
 
 
 Opportunities  
● Positive impact on research  
● Potential appropriation of 
AI and other emerging 
technologies for the greater 
good  
● Role of various actors in 
capacity building 
evaluating whether the tech 
addresses our needs and 
priorities in sectors such as 
health, and education  
● Potential for Africa to have 
its own data centres; 
considering various factors 
such as readily available 
energy sour ces.   
Risks  
● AI cannot fix everything, 
and cannot replace human 
beings, especially in 
content moderation as it 
lacks historical context  
● Risks to individual rights 
particularly privacy, and 
safety of data collected e.g 
when some organisations 
sell data  ● Continental approach at the 
AU Level and  at regional 
organisations. e.g. EAC, 
ECOWAS  
 
● Data cooperatives; 
leveraging on the youth 
population  
 
● Reflect on why and how 
more intentionally; beyond 
data sovereignty/centres and 
national interests  
 
● Enforcement mechanisms 
that enhance our resilience  
 
● Ratification of Malabo 
Convention to reach the 
threshold and then amend to 
reflect context  
 
● Children rights approach in 
AI Strategy  
 
● Cyber diplomacy, which is  
lacking in the continent, 
there is also no information ● AU and other 
Regional 
Blocs  
● Private Sector 
actors  
● Governments  ● A framework on 
digital diplomacy 
and fostering 
cooperation  
● Eliminate silos 
between countries 
and regions e.g 
Africa South of 
Sahara and North 
Africa  
● Establishment of a 
data exchange point 
in Africa  
● Encourage/ support 
States to have 
specific institutions 
on data governance 
and resource them  
● Create/enable 
platform s for 
collaboration e.g. 
conferences, 
practical simulation 
exercises  
● Address knowledge 
gaps on AI to avoid 
potential divide  
35 ● Lack of representation of 
marginalised/minority 
groups in the design of the 
AI that may enhance 
existing biases offline and 
catalyse other issues such 
as data colonisation  
● Risks from cyber breach  
● Potential exclusion of 
persons who lack the 
relevant skill s  
● Social impacts of AI vs the 
profit considerations  
 sharing and cooperation to 
address challenges e.g. 
South Africa fibre optic 
cables running in Nigeria 
territorial waters. 
Cooperation is necessary for 
solutions towards sharing 
costs and resources. Th e 
challenge extends to 
departments at the national 
level and even between 
actors in the private sector  
 ● Clarify what data is 
needed; specific data 
sets 
● Establish binding 
principles to an 
extent; for 
operationalisation 
and enforcement  
Key Messages  a. Capacity building; address knowledge gaps and create a common understanding  
b. Enhanced collaboration between stakeholders who play various roles in the sector  
c. View the GDC as a living document and continuing platform for the exchange  
d. Interopera bility as a principle; Africa has not been involved as much in the global standard -setting bodies e.g. ISO, ITF, ITU and 
thus there is need to enhance meaningful participation of Africa through multi -stakeholder participation, consistent participation 
and availing resources

and other emerging technologies 
offer?  How can they be regulated?  
 Who should be in charge of 
standard setting and 
regulation?  How can GDC 
contribute to

 Opportunities  
● Applications in all sectors to make 
them more efficient and even 
transform them, improve people’s 
life (agriculture, health, economy, 
innovation, cultural inclusion, 
education)  
● Transcription to local languages in 
Africa with application in society, 
health  (talking to automate can be 
more comfortable), education, 
knowledge sharing  
● Creation of new jobs if we are able 
to ‘reconvert’ people  
Risks  
● Biases and fairness: AI can 
amplify social inequalities (those 
without access have less access)  
and can exclude some people  
● AI can be a threat to data privacy  
● AI can be a threat to job security 
for people without the right skills  
● Lack of the appropriate energy and 
infrastructure  
● Algorithms are not transparent  
● Lack/breach of e thics of AI Use  ● Use of AI and ethics  
● Data collection and data 
usage; who can collect 
and what can be 
collected  
● Regulation should not 
be a stopper to 
innovation  
● Impact of society should 
be understood and there 
should be transparency  
● Establish a level playing 
field when  it comes to 
data (big tech have an 
edge on small start -ups): 
should we introduce a 
tax for ‘universal AI’ to 
give AI rights to 
everyone ? 
● How to make it 
participatory so that 
everyone has a voice.  ● Not making things too 
heavy (risk of 
inefficiency if many 
actors are involved): we 
should leverage 
existing bodies  
 
● Multi -actor approach 
(what is the role of each 
entity? How to use the 
existing legal bodies: 
government, regulator  
(different from the 
government), intra -
governmental 
organisations(regional ), 
global  institutions (UN) 
, private sector, 
platform owners, 
academia, foundations, 
civil society, 
communities (tech 
devs, online 
community, diaspora), 
media, SME   
• Guidelines 
for countries  
• Facilitate 
cooperation 
dialogue 
and 
knowledge 
sharing 
between all 
stakeholder  
• Encourage 
countries to 
champion 
AI(and for 
each pillar)

c. We need a balance between regulation and innovation  
d. Gender Agenda; We need more women to be implicated (e.g. African Women in AI)  
e. Facilitate cooperation dialogue and knowledge sharing between a ll stakeholders  
38 13 Closing remarks  
13.1 Ms. Regine Greinbreger, German Cyber Ambassador  
In her closing remarks, Ms. Regine Grienberger  reflected on her own life experience with key 
moments from the time in 1989 when she used an electric typewriter to now when German embassies 
around the World are all connected through an intranet and currently working towards a digital 
embassy.  
ICT has made life richer, connected, and work easier but with current worries around cyber security. 
With the continuous scope and dimensions of change in the sector, one can only imagine what will 
happen in the next 30 years. While at the beginning the new experi ences with technology and the 
tools it provided were like child play with new toys, recent experiences have been quite sobering 
buttressing the need for such consultations.  
Ms. Grienberger  acknowledged that she had learnt a lot about specific needs, aspir ations and 
expectations towards the GDC during these 2 days and that she remains committed to advocating for 
the results of this regional consultation session on the German and international level.  
She finished her remarks by thanking the organisers  and GIZ and the participants for all the good 
ideas and insights shared over the past couple of days.  
13.2 Mr. Yves Iradukunda -Permanent Secretary Ministry of ICT and Innovations in 
Rwanda  
Mr. Iradukunda thanked the participants, the German government for facilitat ing the consultations, 
and the Kenyan government for hosting the consultations. He encouraged participants to carry 
forward the messages emerging from the discussions and conduct national consultations.  
13.3 Eng. Daniel O. Obam, Communications Secretary Nationa l Communications 
Secretariat -representing the Cabinet Secretary for Information, Communication 
and Digital Economy  
Eng. Obam also began his remarks with reflections on his own life experiences chronologically 
acknowledging the advancements of technology making reference to key moments in his life like 
when he  used floppy disks when working  on his master’s dissertation and his very first phone in the 
late 90s that could not fit in his  pocket due to its size.  
He thanked the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for supporting the consultation 
process, the UN Secretary -General’s Envoy on Technology, Under -Secretary -General Mr. Amandeep 
Singh Gill, all government representatives,  and the participants for engaging in the consultations 
targeted towards a formula for implementing the outputs from the GDC Africa consultations.  
13.4  UN Secretary -General’s Envoy on Technology, Under -Secretary -General Mr. 
Amandeep Singh Gill  
 
Mr. Gill thank ed previous speakers and expressed gratitude that he could count on stakeholders as the 
team that co -creates and built the GDC. He also expressed gratitude for the openness and 
collaboration, constructive criticism in a respectful way, as witnessed through out the two -day 
consultations amongst the different stakeholders, a model that could be upscaled or downscaled.  
39 He emphasised the need for a sober appreciation of the opportunities in the digital space while being 
mindful of the risks, collaboration and d ynamism in collaboration.  
Mr. Gill reiterated that his office welcomed all inputs from the national and stakeholder consultations 
and reminded stakeholders of the public call for inputs on the UN Secretary -General’s Envoy on the 
Technology website.  
Final ly, he highlighted the need to continue advocating for evidence -based decision -making and 
respect for contextual experiences which entails the respect, inclusion and acknowledgement of the 
agency of the communities we are seeking to impact being mindful of  the power dynamics, who is 
potentially being excluded and the power implication of technology.  
Mr. Gill’s remarks marked the end of the two -day consultations. Participants were encouraged to stay 
in touch and keep the conversations going and were invited  to a closing reception.  
13.5 Conclusion  
The GDC Africa consultations held in Nairobi, Kenya, marked the beginning of the other regional 
consultations that will follow in Mexico in February 2023 and in India in March 2023. In this regard, 
the participants also got an opportunity to share their messages with the participants in the upcoming 
consultations based on their experiences in Nairobi, through video or  written messages that would be 
transmitted to other participants ( see Annex 2) .  
The inputs from these co nsultations , the submissions to the UNSG’s Envoy on Technology through 
the provided online  tools and policy briefs will inform the GDC that will be agreed on at the Summit 
of the Future  in September 2024, whose theme, ‘multilateral solutions for a better tomorrow’ 
appropriately reflects the intent of the GDC in the fast -evolving digital arena.

46 Annex 2 - Messages to the Americas and Asia in preparation for 
their regional GDC Consultations  
What message(s) would you like to pass on to your colleagues in the Americas and Asia in 
preparation for their regional GDC Consultations?  
Be as inclusive as possible  
Treat Africa like an equal partner.  
Be prepared in advance and participative. Express the strong vision and what you think can really 
have an impact  
We need to leverage our collective resources, knowledge, intelligence and faith in tech for good.  
The consultative forum was enlightening. We were able to exchange ideas on the solutions to data 
protection issues on AI and emerging technologies. Similarly, we were able to analyse the risks 
associated with emerging technologies in the African setup.  
Your voice is critical for th e GDC to reflect the needs of your country, region, and the world. Make 
this consultation process count!  
The consultations here have been very engaging and exciting. Lots of knowledge is shared, learnt 
and developed. The interesting aspect is the opportun ity to contribute to making the digital world a 
better place. We have done our part, over to you!  
Working towards a trustworthy AI is imperative. Collaboration between its users(people), 
companies, technologists and governments is key.  
Your voice is important...make it heard.  
The consultations are participation friendly and I encourage you to say all  that you think is 
important.  
47 1. GDC MUST cater for regional differences and inequalities.  
2. Affordability of digital technology is a huge constraint for African countries. Africa needs 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION to be able to afford safe and sustainable techno logy, both hardware and 
software; both human and machines  
I wish you the best in your deliberations. In Africa we were intentional about sharing insights, 
learnings and best practices and what would work on the continent as well as how to leapfrog our 
challenges and embrace the opportunities technology brings. We  looked at regulations, policies, 
multi -stakeholder consultations and what the GDC could accomplish.  
1. To Discuss Human and Digital measures to bridge the gap between Artificial Intelligence and 
Humanity.  
2. To discuss and encourage emotional based Arti ficial Intelligence and take into consideration that 
some best decisions are made emotionally
