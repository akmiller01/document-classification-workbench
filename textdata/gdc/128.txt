IGF
MAG
Submission
to
the
Consultation
on
the
Global
Digital
Compact
30
April
2023
This
input
has
been
prepared
by
the
2023
IGF
Multistakeholder
Advisory
Group
(MAG)
and
complements
the
submission
of
the
IGF
Leadership
Panel,
which
is
fully
supported
by
the
MAG.
Introduction
to
the
MAG
and
IGF
Ecosystem
The
Internet
Governance
Forum
(IGF)
is
a
global
multistakeholder
platform
that
facilitates
the
discussion
of
public
policy
issues
pertaining
to
the
Internet.
In
accordance
with
the
mandate
of
the
IGF ,
the
Secretary-General
of
the
United
Nations
annually
appoints
a
Multistakeholder
Advisory
Group
(
MAG
),
whose
role
is
to
advise
the
Secretary-General
on
the
programme
and
schedule
of
the
IGF
meetings.
Since
2006,
an
IGF
meeting
has
been
held
annually
-
the
seventeenth
such
event
was
held
in
2022
-
bringing
together
(in
hybrid
format)
participants
from
all
around
the
world
to
take
part
in
a
range
of
workshops
and
sessions
over
the
course
of
a
week.
Aside
from
organising
the
annual
IGF
meeting,
throughout
the
year
the
IGF
community
works
on
several
substantive
activities,
which
are
reported
on
and
discussed
at
the
annual
IGF
meeting.
These
activities
are
collectively
referred
to
as
IGF
intersessional
work
and
take
several
distinct
forms:
Best
Practice
Forums
,
Dynamic
Coalitions
,
and
Policy
Networks
.
Over
the
last
two
decades,
these
activities
have
evolved
to
encompass
the
growing
range
of
issues
relevant
to
the
mandate
of
the
IGF .
Additionally ,
National
and
Regional
IGF
initiatives
(NRIs)
are
organic
and
independent
entities
that
discuss
issues
pertaining
to
Internet
governance
within
their
respective
communities,
while
acting
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
the
global
IGF ,
and
contribute
back
their
feedback
and
messages
to
the
global
IGF .
As
of
2023,
there
are
more
than
155
initiatives,
including
youth
initiatives
located
in
all
five
UN
regions
and
spread
around
the
world.
T o
support
the
NRIs,
the
IGF
Secretariat
hosts
regular
(bi)monthly
virtual
meetings
where
the
NRI
Coordinators
share
updates
and
collaborate
on
the
NRIs’
engagement
with
the
annual
IGF
meeting,
as
well
as
continuously
discussing
further
enhancements
to
support
the
NRIs’
engagement
toward
the
IGF .
The
Role
of
the
IGF
in
Relation
to
the
GDC
The
MAG
welcomes
the
proposal
of
the
United
Nations
Secretary-General
in
‘Our
Common
Agenda’
to
create
a
Global
Digital
Compact
during
the
Summit
of
the
Future
in
September
2024,
along
with
the
call
for
preparation
of
the
Compact
to
be
conducted
via
a
multistakeholder
technology
track.
Since
the
Global
Digital
Compact
is
expected
to
“outline
shared
principles
for
an
open,
free
and
secure
digital
future
for
all”,
covering
issues
related
to
digital
connectivity ,
avoiding
Internet
fragmentation,
providing
people
with
options
as
to
how
their
data
is
used,
application
of
human
rights
online,
and
promoting
a
trustworthy
Internet
by
introducing
accountability
criteria
for
discrimination
and
misleading
content,
we
believe
the
Compact
will
play
a
key
role
in
achieving
the
UN
Sustainable
Development
Goals.
Reiterating
the
input
of
the
IGF
Leadership
Panel,
we
believe
that
the
Global
Digital
Compact
should
not
only
recommend
guiding
principles
for
the
Internet
of
the
future,
but
should
identify
clear
and
concrete
actions
to
achieve
its
objectives,
including
metrics
to
measure
progress
towards
achieving
these
goals.
The
MAG
believes
that
the
Global
Digital
Compact
should
reaf firm
and
commit
to
the
multistakeholder
approach
to
Internet
Governance,
and
should
set
an
example
by
adopting
a
multistakeholder
approach
not
only
during
the
consultation
phase,
but
also
in
the
drafting
and
implementation
of
the
Compact.
W e
believe
that
the
IGF ,
in
accordance
with
its
mandate,
can
play
an
important
role
in
supporting
the
drafting
of
the
Global
Digital
Compact.
Following
the
current
consultation
phase,
we
suggest
that
a
Multistakeholder
Drafting
Group
be
established
to
support
the
development
of
the
Global
Digital
Compact.
The
MAG
would
welcome
the
chance
to
work
with
the
Co-Facilitators
to
support
the
establishment
and
work
of
such
a
drafting
group.
The
MAG
believes
that
the
existing
mechanisms,
especially
those
that
make
up
the
IGF
ecosystem,
can
and
should
evolve
to
support
the
Global
Digital
Compact
implementation
and
follow-up.
The
IGF
should
act
as
a
central
space
for
taking
stock
and
assessing
implementation
of
the
Compact’ s
principles
and
commitments
going
forward.

A
Multistakeholder
Contribution
to
the
GDC
The
MAG
believes
it
is
essential
that
the
Global
Digital
Compact
incorporate
and
reflect
the
content
of
the
Addis
Ababa
IGF
Messages
(included
as
an
Annex
to
this
submission)
and
the
IGF
2022
Outputs
,
both
of
which
are
the
result
and
record
of
a
year-long
process,
culminating
in
the
2022
Internet
Governance
Forum
in
Addis
Ababa,
Ethiopia.
They
represent
the
extensive,
focused
consideration
by
the
global,
multistakeholder
community
of
the
issues
and
themes
identified
for
the
Global
Digital
Compact.
IGF
2022
The
IGF
2022
process
launched
with
the
first
MAG
meeting
and
Open
Consultation
of
the
year ,
held
virtually
from
23-25
February .
At
this
meeting
it
was
agreed
that,
given
the
significance
of
the
UN
Secretary-General’ s
call
for
a
Global
Digital
Compact,
the
2022
IGF
agenda
should
be
structured
around
themes
that
spoke
directly
to
the
issues
identified
in
‘Our
Common
Agenda’.
The
result
was
an
open
call
to
the
global
community
for
session
proposals
around
five
themes:
-
Connecting
All
People
and
Safeguarding
Human
Rights
-
A voiding
Internet
Fragmentation
-
Governing
Data
and
Protecting
Privacy
-
Enabling

IGF
2022:
Intersessional
W ork
In
2022,
two
Best
Practice
Forums
(BPFs)
s
and
two
Policy
Networks
(PNs)
were
implemented:
●
BPF
on
Cybersecurity ,
focused
on
identifying
further
cybersecurity
initiatives,
bringing
the
voices
of
those
most
af fected
by
cybersecurity
events
forward,
and
analysing
the
complex
interplay
between
norms
and
cybercrime
legislation.
●
BPF
Gender
and
Digital
Rights,
focused
on
impact
of
regulations
from
a
gender
justice
perspective;
●
PN
on
Meaningful
Access,
focused
on
persistent
challenges
to
meaningful
and
universal
Internet
access;
●
PN
on
Internet
Fragmentation,
focused
on
definition
and
impact
of
the
fragmentation.
The
twenty-four
IGF
Dynamic
Coalitions
(DCs)
worked
as
independent,
multistakeholder
expert
discussion
groups
on
a
variety
of
topics,
respecting
common
standards
of
transparency
and
inclusiveness
(open
archives,
open
membership,
open
mailing
lists).
The
DC
network
specifically
collaborated
throughout
the
year
to
explore
how
they
could
support
the
Global
Digital
Compact
and
the
topic
was
discussed
during
their
dedicated
main
session
at
the
IGF
in
Addis
Ababa.
More
than
one
hundred
and
fifty-five
national,
regional
and
youth
IGF
initiatives
(NRIs)
coordinated
to
identify ,
through
a
bottom-up
process,
their
collective
thematic
focus
on
the
principles
for
the
core
of
the
Internet.
This
was
discussed
in
a
dedicated
session
at
the
2022
IGF .
In
facilitating
so
many
to
come
together
and
discuss
in
a
diverse
range
of
formats
the
very
issues
that
the
Global
Digital
Compact
intends
to
address,
the
2022
IGF
meeting
and
intersessional
activities
must
be
understood
as
primary
consultative
activities
in
preparation
of
the
Compact.
The
Addis
Ababa
IGF
Messages
and
the
IGF
2022
Outputs,
as
the
record
of
these
ef forts,
should
be
recognised
as
an
important
basis
for
the
drafting
and
negotiation
of
the
Global
Digital
Compact.
IGF
2023
as
Further
Input
to
the
GDC
The
MAG
believes
that,
in
addition
to
the
outputs
of
the
2022
IGF ,
noting
that
the
preparation
of
the
Global
Digital
Compact
will
continue
well
into
2024,
there
is
also
an
important
opportunity
for
the
2023
IGF
discussions
to
provide
valuable
and
timely
input
to
this
process.
The
MAG
has
agreed
that
the
IGF
2023
will
again
be
structured
so
as
to
engage
specifically
with
issues
to
be
addressed
in
the
Global
Digital
Compact,
and
will
produce
a
further
set
of
clear ,
concise
messages
on
these
themes.
W e
see
it
as
vital
that
these
Messages
(to
be
published
in
October/November
2023),
as
the
output
of
the
global
IGF
multistakeholder
community ,
be
reflected
in
the
drafting
and
negotiation
of
the
Global
Digital
Compact.
Conclusion
T o
conclude,
we
wish
to
reiterate
that,
going
forward,
the
MAG
sees
an
important
and
unique
role
for
the
IGF
in
supporting
the
implementation
of
the
principles
and
commitments
that
emerge
from
the
Global
Digital
Compact.
The
IGF
sits
at
the
intersection
of
multistakeholder
and
multilateral
processes;
through
the
massive
network
of
people
and
institutions
that
make
up
the
IGF
community ,
it
can
provide
valuable
insights
and
support
to
multilateral
processes
and
UN
Member
States
as
they
engage
the
ongoing
challenge
of
digitalisation.
The
IGF
is
the
world’ s
foremost
inclusive
and
open
public
participation
platform
on
digital
policy
and
regulation,
and
continues
to
evolve
and
improve
in
response
to
the
evolving
needs
of
its
stakeholders.
It
is
vital
that
the
Global
Digital
Compact
take
full
advantage
of
and
fully
integrate
with
the
IGF
and
its
global,
multistakeholder
community .
The
MAG
looks
forward
to
collaborating
closely
with
the
Co-Facilitators,
the
Of fice
of
the
Secretary-General’ s
Envoy
on
T echnology ,
UN
Member
States
and
all
stakeholder
to
ensure
that
the
Global
Digital
Compact
is
a
bold,
clear
and
positive
step
towards
an
open,
free
and
secure
digital
future
for
all.

Addis Ababa IGF Messages  
Connecting All People and Safeguarding Human Rights  
 
Theme  
 
The UN Secretary -General’s proposed Global Digital Compact (GDC) has as its first principle to “Connect 
all people to the Internet, including all schools .” This recognizes that Internet connectivity and access have 
become prerequisites for ensuring the livelihood s, safety and education of people all around the world  – 
and that Internet in schools provides crucial points of access, makes informational resources available to 
all students, and builds digital literacy from the earliest stages of life.   Yet 2. 7 billion people remain 
unconnected  today , with those in least developed countries and rural communities most disadvantaged . 
Meaningful access  reaches beyond mere connectivity and  is inextricable from the safeguarding of human 
rights online.  Access that co ntributes to the wellbeing of societies must have human rights at its centre.  
This includes, among many others, the ability for users to express themselves freely, for the unfettered 
exercise of democratic and political participation, for persons of all b ackgrounds to experience the 
Internet without fear of harassment or discrimination, and for children to enjoy the same rights and 
protections online as they do offline. The Internet is both an enabler of rights and must seamlessly 
incorporate established h uman rights, as we increase our digital dependence for routine functions, and 
as boundaries between life “online” and “offline” are becoming  less significant . 
 
Messages  
 
Digital Divide s 
• The digital divide s between different countries  and regions  remain  powerful factor s affecting 
national and international development , including progress towards the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs ). Of particular concern  are least developed countries  and small island developing states 
(SIDS).   Digital divides  are much more than connectivity divide s.  Meaningful access includes issues 
of accessibility, affordability, content, services, digital literacy and other capabilities as well as 
connectivity.   Affordability is a particular problem for many  people , especially  in the Global South.   
• The COVID -19 pandemic demonstrated the Internet’s role in enabling individual and economic 
resilience, but also illustrated the extent to which those who lack connectivity or meaningful access 
are disadvantaged , potentially exacerbating  other  inequalities.   It will take time to understand the 
full impact and implications of COVID -related interventions concerning access, use and human rights.  
• Some groups within all societies experience deeper  digital divides  or have less meaningful access 
than others .  Women in many societies are less connected than men  and make less use of 
connectivity .  Digital disadvantage is greater among vulnerable and marginalised communities , and 
many people experience multiple disadvan tages through the combination of factors related to age, 
gender, ethnicity, language, social class and other factors .  Targeted initiatives in infrastructure,

Addis Ababa IGF Messages  
devices and services can he lp to improve the access rates for less-connected  social groups , but need 
to be accompanied by measures to address other deficiencies in meaningful access  and should be 
associated with other measures to address disadvantage and discrimination.  
• Resilient and secure digital infrastructure is crucial for digital inclusion.  Governments should 
protect and promote required infrastructure, including grid and off -grid power as well as 
communications networks.   In parts of Africa and other continents, large dista nces between rural 
and remote communities , including  those  in SIDS , make last -mile connectivity commercially 
unattractive to the private sector.   Connectivity, speed and reliability are important aspects of 
infrastructure provision.   It will take time and investment to improve the capacity  of infrastructure 
and address  regional imbalances, especially in  rural areas.   
• Cooperation amongst stakeholder groups is important in ensuring and enabling access.  
Governments, and multistakeholder  partners, should support the establishment and work of 
effectiv e regulatory agencies and frameworks , address challenges in commercially unattractive 
areas , and encourage  innovative approaches to connectivity  including community networks , 
appropriate spectrum allocation , access delivered by low earth orbit satellites  and the availability of 
local content, including content in local languages . 
 
The Gender Digital Divide  and women’s rights  
• Men are significantly more likely to be online or have mobile connectivity than women .  The gender 
digital gap is particularly wide  in Least Developed Countries .  SDG target 9c, which seeks to achieve  
universal , affordable  Internet access , cannot be met until this gap is closed.  
• The threat of violence and harassment is a deterrent to women’s online participation.   Online 
gender -based violence is an important factor driving and reinforcing gender inequality in Internet 
access  and usage , leading to some women leaving online spaces.  The role of technology services and 
platforms in propagating gender -based violence should be acknowledged and addressed.  Women 
should be supported by guidance to resist  and redress  online gender -based violence, including 
through community -led helplines.  Resources, community guidelines and reporting on platforms 
should be made available in local languages.  
• Concepts of gender equality, inclusion, and women’s rights and protection should  be incorporated 
into the Global Digital Compact  (GDC), as has been proposed by UN Women.  
 
Human Rights  and digital development  
• Universal access should respect human  rights , to ensure the Internet is both accessible and safe 
for all.   These  include freedom of expression and association, the right to privacy and other civil and 
political and economic, social and cultural rights  set out in international rights agreements.   Internet 
governance structures and the design of digital technologies  should respect these rights .  Standards 
development organisations should consider inviting participation by experts in online human rights, 
from all stakeholder communities, in their work.  
• Transparency, accountability and due diligence regarding human right s are the responsibilities of 
all stakeholder groups, including  intergovernmental and international organisations, governments , 
the private sector, the technical community and civil society .  This will require alignment of business

practices with digital rights and cooperation between stakeholders to address issues such as 
disinformation, discrimination and hate speech, especially at times of political unrest, elections and 
transfers of power . 
• Access to the Internet provides a crucial opportunity for access to information and expression.   
Governments should avoid recourse to Internet shutdowns  because of their negative impact on both 
human rights and economic welfare .  Social media and technology companies should support citizens 
in their advocacy efforts concerning shutdowns.  
• It is important  to improve the monitoring and implementation of digital rights.   A number of 
suggestions have been made to establish international monitoring arran gements within the UN 
system, with multistakeholder engagement .  These  could complement and build on existing  
mechanisms , including both those concerned with digital development  and rights  and those in other 
spheres  such as climate change.   
• The internet provides opportunities for enhancing rights to education , as part of broader policies 
for educational improvement .  The quality of education in the Global South, particularly during the 
pandemic, has suffered due to a lack of connectivity.  While ICTs can enable meaningful access for 
students, differences in global and local adoption rates have exacerbated pre -pandemic inequalities.  
Experience during the pandemic can be used to improve the use of digital resources in the future.  
• Efforts should be made to help  smaller and local businesses take maximum advantage of the 
Internet.   Use of digital tools by small and medium -sized enterprises has increased greatly since 2020, 
but micro -enterprises still face significant challenges in their ability  to digi talise their businesses.    
• Labour market changes built around online platforms present both opportunities and challenges 
for job creation  and job quality , especially  for women who play a greater part than men in  the

Avoiding Internet Fragmentation  
 
 
Theme  
 
 
The maintenance of a global, open and  interoperable Internet  is a core value of the IGF .  This implies that 
common technical standards and protocols continue to be deployed to achieve a network of 
interconnected networks across countries and regions , and that standards for content and service s are 
consistent with human rights and with the rule of law .  The call for this  – applying a framework to the 
Internet that prioritises the rights and freedoms of users as well as , and through , infrastructural, end -to-
end coherence – has been echoed in plans for the GDC.  
 
The risk of fragmentation is real and mounting.   While technical and commercial fragmentation  – where 
the functioning of the Internet is impacted by a mix of voluntary and involuntary conditions and business 
practices  – need s to be addressed, fragmentation by government policy that affects the open and 
interoperable character of the Internet is also of  concern.  
 
 
Messages  
 
Understanding the issues  
 
• The Global Digital Compact provides  an opportunity to reassert the value of an open interconnected 
internet for the realisation of the UN Charter, achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 
and exercise of human rights.    There is widespread agreement within the Internet community abo ut 
the value of a global, unfragmented Internet as a platform for human activity.   
 
• The issues raised in discussions of Internet fragmentation are multi -layered, and different 
stakeholders give a variety of meanings and interpretations to the term.   Some are most concerned 
with technical and infrastructural aspects of the Internet, while others focus on public policy issues 
including access, rights and impacts on user experience.  These are explored in a draft framework 
prepared by the IGF Policy Network on Internet Fragmentation.  Respect and understanding for 
different people’s perceptions and experience of fragmentation is essential  if we are to reach  effective 
and coordinated re sponses .  
 
• A wide range of political, economic, and technical factors can potentially drive fragmentation.  
However, diversity and decentralisation should not be mistaken for fragmentation .  T hese are 
fundamentally positive aspects of the Internet’s architecture and operations.

Addressing the risk of fragmentation  
 
• Effective multistakeholder governance mechanisms are essential for the governance of a global 
unfragmented Internet.   There is a need to reinforce  trust in th ese mechanisms, to ensure that they 
are robust and sustainable, and to foster coherence across governance structures as they evolve to 
meet new challenges.  
 
• There is a need for vigilance concerning new or developing risks of fragmentation.   Global 
cooperation and coordination will be essential in identifying early warning signs, mapping the impact 
of policies and other developments, and preparing to address the implications of th ese changes.  A 
multistakeholder approach is best suited to as sess, evaluate and monitor the potential unintended 
consequences of measures that affect the Internet and to suggest effective alternatives that avoid or 
mitigate the risks of fragmentation.  The IGF Policy Network on Internet Fragmentation is a positive 
example of this approach.  
 
• Internet openness is instrumental in fostering the enjoyment of Internet users' human rights, 
promoting competition and equality of opportunity, and safeguarding the generative peer -to-peer 
nature of the Internet.   Debates about n et neutrality and non -discriminatory traffic management are 
only part of broader discussions in this context.  Net neutrality is necessary but not sufficient to 
guarantee Internet openness.  Infrastructural and data interoperability, and platform and devic e 
neutrality , are also necessary.  
 
• While legal, regulatory and policy approaches will differ around the world, active coordination  across 
international boundaries  is vital to ensuring that fragmented approaches do not threaten the global 
reach and interoperability of the Internet.   Maintaining the integrity of the global network requires 
international regulatory collaboration and consensus on basic principles .  
 
• Many different factors affect the experience of the Internet in different jurisdictions , including 
different social, demographic, economic, cultural and political contexts as well as technical and 
infrastructure issues.   The pursuit of some forms of digital governance at national level can increase 
the risk of fragmentation at the technical level of the Internet .  However,  regulatory frameworks must 
also consider different requirements in different contexts and keep pace with rapid change in 
technolog y and services.  
 
• There is a need for  greater  knowledge - and information -sharing among stakeholders , to further 
discussion of cyber -diplomacy as an evolving phenomenon, and to consider the scope for  appropriate 
interventions .  Standard -making bodies should continue to improve outreach and engagement with 
stakeholders and to improve understanding between  policy and technical communities.   Technical 
decisions that bear policy implications should be discussed by standardisation bodies through the 
direct involvement of all affected stakeholders.

Governing Data and Protecting Privacy  
 
Theme  
 
Data are the key resource of the globalised digital age.  The movement of data drives economies, while  
data  analysis, including  big data analytics, has been the basis for remarkable innovations across 
disciplines, from finance, to health and law enforcement.    
 
But the widespread use, routine flow across borders and fungibility  of data  remain sensitive and 
unresolved topic s.  As a  transnational, commercial asset, data flows  operate in an environment in which 
there is  little consistency between national legal regimes  and where there are significant enforcement 
challenges .  The privacy of personal data is too often sacrificed over the course of data exchanges, from 
the point of collection to application and storage, with deep consequences for trust and security.  
 
To harness the significant promise of data, economically and f or research purposes, discussions need to 
be relaunched around governance, integrity and the protection of people s’ privacy.  
 
Messages  
 
The centrality of data  
• Data have become  a critical resource in an increasingly  digital age.   Data flows are crucial to  
international cooperation in many fields including scientific research, law enforcement, and national 
and global security.  Data, data security and data protection are critical enablers of sustainable 
development.  The effective u se and sharing of data on a global scale can help overcome shared 
challenges and the threats posed by cascading crises such as pandemics and climate change.   
 
• Data can generate both profit and significant social value.   The benefits of the data -driven economy, 
however, have so far been unevenly distributed.  Many people  are concerned that they may become 
primarily providers of data rather than beneficiaries.  
 
• The relationship between those who generate and those who use  data is important .  Data poverty 
is a significant problem, especially in local communities and among vulnerable segments of 
populations.  Lack of data privacy and inadequate data protection undermine trust in data 
management .  It is important to build dat a literacy and data capacities across levels of government, 
in educational curricula and for the general public.    
 
• Data management and governance are complex issues in both national and international 
governance. Developments in data – including big data analytics, innovations in artificial intelligence 
and machine learning, and innovations across public policy dimensio ns and the SDGs – demonstrate 
the need for appropriate consideration of political, economic and social impacts and for nuanced

policy interventions.  Government and regulatory institutions need the infrastructure and capacity 
required to implement effectiv e, integrated national data governance frameworks.  Application 
developers have a responsibility to ensure ethical and safe design.  
 
Data privacy and data justice  
• Data privacy is not a matter of convenience or good practice but of human rights .  As well as the 
rights to privacy, equal treatment and non -discrimination  it affects  access to other human  rights such 
as those  to healthcare, education and public services , as well as  democratic rights such as free 
expression and association.  Privacy laws should be substantial, evidence -based and capable of clear 
enforcement.  Those affected by them should be able to understand their implications clearly.   
 
• Data flows and data exchan ge should take place without compromising data privacy .  The privacy 
of personal data has often been sacrificed in the processes of data exchange, between the gathering 
of information and its application, with intentional and unintentional risks to trust a nd security.  
Internet access and use should not be dependent on data -tracking: users should have the right to 
choose the extent to which their information is shared, including information derived from their 
online activity.   Personal data should not be exported into jurisdictions which do not provide 
adequate guarantees.  
 
• Policies should reach beyond data protection to data justice in which people have choices over how 
personal data are used and where they can share the retur ns and benefits of innovation  brought by 
datasets derived from their data.   Privacy protections should thereby contribute to a safer and more 
prosperous digital economy.  
 
• Governments and regulators should ensure that personal data are protected , identifying the 
differentiated responsibilities of different stakeholders and without imposing undue burdens or 
responsibilities on individual users .  Data governance policies should be developed with 
multistakeholder input to ensure that implementation challenges are understood.    
 
• Privacy and data protection are particularly significant for the governance of artificial intelligence 
and machine learning .  All stakeholders in the AI supply chain have a role to play in upholding privacy 
rights.   
 
• There is a need for independent oversight bodies equipped with appropriate resources.  Data 
protection offices should have  a mandate to manage data registration, pro vide  guidance, implement 
investigations and resolve complaints from data subjects.    
 
 
Data governance  
• Issues concerning data governance should not be treated in silos or in isolation from their impacts.   
The current data governance landscape is a fragmented patchwork of national, regional, and 
international rules involving responsibilities for national governments, private sector businesses and 
individuals.

Addis Ababa IGF Messages  
• Greater coherence is needed on a global level to achieve a balanced approach in which data work 
for people and the planet.  Existing legislation and regulatory frameworks at national, regional, and 
international levels are often insufficient and fail to ke ep up with the pace of change in technology 
and applications.  They should seek to ensure high security standards by businesses and other 
organisations responsible for holding data.   
 
• Different contexts and challenges, histories, cultures, legal tradition s, and regulatory structures 
mean that there cannot be one rigid set of rules for all.    Different individuals and organisations also 
interpret broadly similar approaches in different ways.  However, while countries and regions must 
develop their own tailored approaches to data governance there should be consistency and 
interoperability to facilitate data flows and ensure a level  playing field.  
  
• Transparency, participation and accountability are important aspects of good data governance.   
Important considerations in governing data include (but are not limited to): data standards and 
classi fication; data sharing, exchange and interoperability; data security and data privacy; data 
infrastructure; data and digital identity; data justice and fairness; data traceability, transparency and 
explicability; data minimization and data limitation; data  accuracy and quality; data bias, 
marginalization and discrimination; the data life cycle, specificity and  retention of data use; data 
accountability and data ethics; data harms, data security and data protection  
 
• Many stakeholders have roles within this context and should exercise their power and influence to 
promote effective data governance , including regulators, researchers, standards organizations, 
consumer organisations and end users.  Policies for data governance should be developed with input 
from this multistakeholder community which has expertise in both legal debates around privacy and 
the “real world” challenges of implementing effective data privacy solutions.  
 
• Developing economies need to enhance their institutional capacities to govern, use and manage 
data in a comprehensive, objective and evidence -based manner, including through regional and 
global cooperation.  This requires improved understanding of the institutional capacities of 
government officials and stakeholders.  
 
 
Cross -border data flows  
 
• Cross -border data flows are essential to many aspects of e -commerce and digital trade.  Efficient 
intra -regional trade and supply chain management rel ies on the smooth flow of data as well as goods, 
services  and capital.  However, all of these require complex cross -cutting considerations for regulatory 
convergence, harmoni sation of legal frameworks, Internet governance, information and 
communications technology policy reform and strategic regional infrastructure implementation.  
 
• Current multilateral, regional and bilateral  trade agreements are  insufficient for current and future  
cross -border data flows.    These operate in a largely unregulated environment with little consistency 
between national legal regimes.  Approaches differ and are contextual, generating barriers to trade , 
while many countries do not currently have adequate legislation or enforcement capacity .  There is a 
growing  need to develop and harmoni se measures  to manage cross -border flows that facilitate

Enabling Safety, Security and Accountability  
 
Theme  
The security of the Internet is under threat in several  ways.  Traditional cybersecurity deals with the 
protection of networks, devices and data from unauthorised access or criminal use.  This encompasses 
the ongoing problem of cyber -attacks, whether they are perpetrated by individuals or state -sanctioned, 
and whether the targets are civic, commercial or governmental .  Factors such as the absence of broad and 
binding cybersecurity agreements  and insufficiently secure networks contribute to the loss of  
opportunities to capitalise fully on the economic benefits of digital technologies, particularly for 
developing countries.  
 
Issues of safety, security and accountability are multifaceted, including di stinct issues concerning 
infrastructure, services, content and other aspects of the Internet.  Our understanding of  safety  and 
security , for instance,  now includes  persistent challenge s of online misinformation and disinformation.  In 
recent years, these  have been factors in aggravating the effects of the COVID -19 pandemic as well as 
posing  significant risks to electoral processes around the world.  This has emphasised  the need for 
accountability and clear criteria for misleading content.    
 
The conc ept of ‘safety’  may be further widened to include environmental safety, considering efforts to 
‘green’ the Internet and reduce carbon emissions associated with digital consumption.   The need to 
address the environmental impact of digitalisation i s an incre asingly important theme in IGF discussions.  
 
Messages  
The role of policymakers  
• Cybersecurity should be seen as a central challenge for Internet policy.   Considerations of trust and 
security should be integral to the development of safe, secure access , including respect for human 
rights, openness and transparency in policymaking, and a multistakeholder approach that serves the 
interests of end -users . 
 
• Ensuring cybersecurity and preventing cybercrime  are both important areas of policy that require 
serious attention and the development of expertise.   They differ in purpose, however, and the 
approach required for each is different.  A n approach that is effective in one will not be effective in 
the other without adaptation and reformulation . 
 
• Cybersecurity and cybercrime issues have cross -organisational and cross -border dimensions.  
Tackling these requires:

a) whole -of-government and whole -of-society approaches  that include strong partnerships and 
coordinated efforts , involving parliaments , regulators and other relevant government authorities 
and agencies, the private sector, the technical community, academia, and civil society; and  
b) efficient and effective regional and international cooperation  that is intergovernmental, 
multilateral and multistakeholder.  
 
• Governments , the private sector and the technical commun ity should take care to avoid adopting 
cybercrime laws and establishing standards that negatively affect the work of cybersecurity 
defenders.   They should invite all stakeholders to engage in policy development  and facilitate 
interaction and sharing of experience and expertise  between the ir different communities.  
 
• Civil society should participate  in both cybercrime and cybersecurity discussions.   To do so 
effectively, civil society stakeholders should educate themselves on the different approaches and 
issues involved , and work with other stakeholders to gather the information and resources required  
to participate  fully  in making  policy.  
 
Cybersecurity  
 
• The international community should explore practical ways to mainstream cybersecurity capacity -
building into broader digital development efforts.   Tensions between the desire to advance digital 
transformation and the need to enable effective cybersecurity pose  challenges in  enabling a safe, 
secure online environment and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.  While doing more to 
increase the resilience of digital infrastructure is necessary, it is not sufficient.  Translating existing 
international agreements into feasible actions is long overdue.  
• Standards that enable cybersecurity are essential for an open, secure and resilient Internet that 
enables social progress and economic growth , and are particularly important in protecting thos e 
who are not yet connected .  Such standards have been developed , but their use needs to grow 
significantly to make them fully effective.  The United Nations could  help accelerate the global 
adoption of key standards by including their promotion in the Glo bal Digital Compact, by supporting 
advocacy and capacity building and by encouraging  initiatives to test and monitor deployment.  Early 
awareness raising and capacity building on standards should not be forgotten as priorities  in areas 
where many still have to get connected and the internet is growing.   
• More needs to be done to improve national policymakers’ and other stakeholders’ awareness of 
the challenges of cybersecurity and of international norms and principles.   This should include 
awareness and capacity -building concerning the links between sustainable development and 
cybersecurity, bringing diverse stakeholders together to m obilise effective, sustainable and inclusive 
stewardship of international cooperation for cyber -resilience.  A number of international initiatives 
have been established to support this.  Opportunities to finance cyber resilience also need to be 
addressed b y funding agencies and other stakeholders.  
• Cybersecurity norms must make a difference to the personal  experiences of Internet users past, 
present and future.   Listening to the experiences of individual and organisational victims of 
cybersecurity attacks , and those of first responders , is important in this context , particularly when 
developing new norms.

Cybercrime  
 
• Cybercrime poses an increasing threat to many Internet users.   Regulations countering cybercrime 
should be sensitive to the size, capacity and resources of platforms.  Legal obligations should consider 
the diversity of the technical sector, and acknowledge the needs  and circumstances  of smaller 
businesses  in adherin g to their legal obligations , for instance in  counter ing terrorist and violent 
extremist exploitation of their services.  
 
• Governments and policymakers should ensure that legal responses to criminal and terrorist use of 
the Internet safeguard both the rule of law and human rights , taking  freedom of expression  fully into 
account  and ensuring  transparency and accountability  in the implementation of measures against 
cybercrime . 
 
Content and disinformation  
 
• Disinformation can and should be addressed through mechanisms that address the risks faced by  
individuals and societies while  protecting  freedom of expression , pluralism  and democratic process .  
Support for professional journalism and media plays an important part in efforts to address 
disinformati on, including commitment to establish ed journalistic norms.  
 
• Media and digital literacy skills empower citizens to take a more critical view of the content or 
information they encounter, helping to identify disinformation and misinformation and strengthen 
democratic participation.   Digital literacy education can help to  increase online safety awareness, 
especially for  more vulnerable individuals and communities.    Initiatives  need to be sensitive to the 
needs and risks associated with  different d emographic  groups.   Different approaches  for young 
people and older generations, for example, must respond  to different usage patterns.    
 
• Educational curricula should include digital literacy skills that help children to be safe online.   
Initiatives should involve  parents, teachers  and guardians .  Lawmakers and digital platforms should 
take responsibility to ensure children’s safety within a framework of children’s rights online  consistent 
with international rights agreements including the UN Conventi on on the Rights of the Child.  
 
• The domain name system has limited technical capacity in this context .  Continued stakeholder 
dialogue should clarify when and how it  may be used to remedy specific content problems, and should  
strengthen due -process norms .    
 
• Encryption plays an important role in building an open, safe and democratic Internet  and helps users 
to achieve safety, privacy and freedom of speech.   Issues co ncerning law enforcement and user’s 
ability to manage access in areas such as child protection need to be addressed.  
 
• Translation issues present significant barriers that can inhibit end -users’ meaningful engagement 
with platforms’ community standards and guidelines .  Key terms are sometimes  poorly translated , 
resulting in ambiguous interpretations.  Engagement with different language communities to improve 
the accuracy and relevance of translation, including the communication of concepts with out direct

Addressing Advanced Technologies, including Artificial 
Intelligence ( AI) 
 
 
Theme  
Advanced digital technologies increasingly shape our economy and society, including  artificial intelligence 
(AI) systems which guide our online experiences, power smart devices, and influence our own decisions 
and those that  others take about us, as well a s robotics and Internet of Things applications that are 
deployed in areas as diverse as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture.  Beyond their promises, these 
technologies come with pitfalls.  Algorithmic decision -making , for instance,  can result in bias, 
discrimination, stereotyping  and wider social inequality, while AI -based systems can pose risks to human 
safety  and human rights.  Internet of Things devices come with privacy and cybersecurity challenges. 
Augmented and virtual reality rai ses issues of public safety, data protection, and consumer protection.  
Taking advantage of the opportunities offered by advanced technologies, while addressing related 
challenges and risks is a task that no one actor can take up on its own.  Multistakehold er dialogue and 
cooperation – involving  governments, intergovernmental organisations, tech nology  companies, civil 
society, and other stakeholders  – are required to ensure that these technologies are developed and 
deployed in a manner that is human -centred and respectful of human rights.  
 
 
Messages  
 
Governance  
• Advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence,  should be designed in a way that respects 
the rule of law, human rights, democratic values and diversity, and includes appropriate safeguards.   
They  should benefit people and the planet by driving inclusive growth, sustainable development and 
well-being.  Oversight and enforcement mechanisms should follow principles and rules, with AI actors 
being held accountable for any damage caused.   
• The assumption that technology necessarily enhances equality is flawed.   Those who design machine 
learning technologies and the data used to train AI applications are often unrepresentative of their 
societies.  Technologies can amplify inequalities and cause harm , particularly to vulnerable and 
marginalised groups.   
• Societies n eed to adjust to the transformation that AI will bring about through changes to their  
cooperation framework and governance model.  Building a human -centred intelligent society 
requires the full cooperation of government, enterprises, social organisations a nd academia.   Ongoing 
human control remains essential, to ensure that algorithms do not lead to  outcomes that are

undesired or uncontrolled.  Breaking down silos between engineers and policy experts is critical to 
achieving this.  
• Global agreement on AI norms cannot be achieved in one straightforward process.  While there are 
some existing norms , these are mostly soft laws rather than binding principles.   The development of 
meaningful global standards will require  effective  partici pation from all countries , including 
developing and developed countries,  and inputs from regional initiatives , as well as the engagement 
of all stakeholders . 
• Capacity -building is important in efforts to address advanced technologies.   Policies for AI liter acy, 
skills development and  language resources for minority languages are needed in order to formulate a 
truly global approach to advanced technologies . 
 
 
Trust, security and privacy  
 
• Regulatory frameworks should include  principles to help  social media and other platforms fulfil due 
diligence obligations for the management of content that could damage  democracy and human 
rights.   Frameworks should contribute to the global conversation on online content moderation to 
empower users, including the most vulnerable groups and users of minority languages.   Emerging 
technologies such as affective computing, which consider how computers may recognise, interpret 
and simulate human emotions , require substantive ethical assessment.  
 
• Transparen cy in the operation and reporting of algorithmic systems is essential for human rights.  
AI facilitates the constant observation and analysis of data to personalise and target content and 
advertising.   The resulting personalised online experiences r un the risk of disaggregating online 
information spaces and limit ing individuals’ exposure to diversity of information.  Lack of information 
pluralism can foster manipulation and deception – furthering inequa lities, undermining democratic 
debates, and potentially enabling digital authoritarianism, hatred  and violence.  
 
• Stakeholders from technical and non -technical communities should share  expertise and work 
together to develop principles , guidelines and standa rds that are sufficiently flexible for application 
in diverse contexts and that foster trust in AI systems.  
 
• It is important to recognise and respect  the different institutional and cultural backgrounds of 
diverse countries and communities , as well as promoting  inclusivity and enabling  international 
cooperation in AI.   
 
 
Rights and content moderation  
 
• It is essential that policies for content governance by online platforms, and their enforcement, are 
in line with international human rights standards.  Artificial intelligence and machine -learning 
technologies are already being used to decide whether cont ent should be posted or removed, what 
content is prioritised and to whom it is disseminated.  These tools play  a significant role in shaping 
political and public discourse  in ways that  affect both individual and collective human rights , including

social, e conomic and cultural rights and rights  to global peace and security.   They are often deployed 
with little or no transparency, accountability,  or public oversight.  This should be rectified.  
 
• The same technologies that can be used to promote human rights can also be used for surveillance, 
to promote violent agendas and in other ways that infringe those rights.   Unintended consequences 
of automated content management  can be  particularly detrimental in times of conflict or crisis when  
they may silence critical voices at a time when they  are most crucial.   
 
• Technical standards play an important role in enabling the development and enhancing the value 
of digital technologies and related infrastructures, services, protocols, applications, and devices .  
They  may also have powerful impacts on human rights.   Yet the technical standard -setting processes 
within standards development organisations do not take hu man rights concerns  fully into 
consideration .  These processes are often opaque, complex, and resource -heavy for civil society and 
other stakeholders to access and follow systematically.   This should be addressed.
