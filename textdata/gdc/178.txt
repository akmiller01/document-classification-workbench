Subject: Submission to the Global Digital Compact informal consultation process –
Transforming climate action through participatory digitalization 
The United Nations University, Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) welcomes the 
opportunity to submit views on the Global Digital Compact (GDC) process and in consultation with 
partners, is pleased to submit this text for consideration.  
Background 
The digitalization wave has exponentially enhanced access to information, thereby broadening avenues to 
collaborate across scales and actors. This democratization of access through technology has opened new 
possibilities to engage with people from all spectrums of the society and can be particularly beneficial in 
enhancing transformative climate action in the small and medium cities of the global south [1]. The same 
holds true for the rural areas – particularly in the global south - where innovations such as mobile money 
and other fin-tech tools are fundamentally reshaping access to information, finance and decision making to 
name a few [2].  
While digital means are increasingly used to assist in managing different levels of governance, an untapped 
potential lies in using these means to facilitate participatory, locally contextualized policy making and 
implementation to catalyze transformative climate action. This holds special significance in the small and 
medium cities of the global south where digital means can augment the capacity of local actors and 
communities to collaborate on forward looking, transformative climate action. We believe that the battle 
against climate change will be won at the local level, and to do so, communities need access to science 
informed localized information and supportive digital means amongst others. However, researchers as well 
as practitioners have pointed out the lack of access as the main hindrance for digital transformation and 
information uptake. At the same time, providing reliable high-speed digital connectivity in many parts of 
the global south remains unaffordable [3]; The poorest 40% of the population in many parts of the world 
remain disenfranchised from Information and Communication (ICT) services [4]. We further argue that 
there is a growing willingness at the local levels of governance to work together with all stakeholders of 
the society. At the same time, as movements like ‘Fridays for Future’ and others have shown, there is a 
growing demand as well as drive from the society to actively participate in climate action and co-create a 
shared future. Given the shared motivation and enthusiasm, digitalization can provide pathways to 
collaborate in an effective and meaningful manner, and in-turn foster transformative climate action.  
Through this submission, we would like to underline synergies between what the Secretary General has 
termed as “two seismic shifts of the 21st century – the climate crisis, and digital transformation” [5], 
particularly from the point of view of localized transformative climate action. This touches upon two themes 
mentioned in the GDC guidelines, namely; a) Connect all people to the internet, including all schools and 
b) Digital commons as a global public good. Through following core principles and commitments, we

 emphasize potential pathways for transformative climate action, especially targeted to the vulnerable and 
underserved communities. 
Core principles to leverage Digitalization to foster Transformative Climate Action   
We recommend that following core principles are embedded in the architecture of global digital compact 
to build on the synergies between transformative climate action and digitalization:  
 Leverage digital public infrastructure (DPI) and data systems to provide safe, trustworthy and 
inclusive public and private digital services at scale with the goal to empower people and catalyze 
participation of all stakeholders  in climate action decision making and implementation processes, 
specially the most vulnerable and marginalized communities , for example through Community 
Learning & Living Labs (CL3).  
 Prioritize local needs and regional priorities  using digital tools such as machine learning and 
artificial intelligence to collect and analyze tailor made dynamic data points and information from 
the local level, particularly through Big Data Analytics.  
 Utilize the potential of digital means to provide swift, transparent, affordable, last mile, multi-
way communication and co-creation channels thereby fostering participation, transparency, 
accountability and ownership in policy processes and climate actions. 
 Support the digital transformation  through decentralized and participatory information 
hubs in communities for example through public schools and community centers.  
 Foster blended data environments to strengthen local data capacities, evidence-based 
policymaking, and local governance  while improving responsiveness to community needs and 
building co-ownership of policies and projects. Further involve citizens in the design and 
management of data ecosystems  and digital infrastructures .  
 Standardize data collection and governance protocols  to promote multi-stakeholder data 
alliances with community groups and the civil society while increasing efficiency and reducing 
redundancy  
 Ensure alignment of data privacy and protection laws with universal declaration of human rights 
with particular attention to safeguard access and dignity of most vulnerable sections of society  
 Promote innovation practices  which are based on principles of openness, diffusion and shared 
vision. This need not rely solely on ‘frontier technologies’ but also involve ‘frugal’ and mundane 
innovations. 
 Critically assess and address pitfalls of digital technologies  (including rebound effects, trade-
offs, unsustainable business models, widening digital inequality, privacy concerns, malevolent 
usages etc.)

 Key Commitments 
To operationalize aforementioned principles, we call for a collective commitment along these lines:  
 Providing  the latest science to inform the decision making and implementation. To do so, it is 
recommended to deepen scientific research that enhances the understanding of impacts of climate 
change as well as digitalization, particularly on Least Developed Countries (LDCs), underserved 
groups and gender disparity. It is further recommended to increase  the related knowledge-
cooperation between countries through academic and practitioner knowledge clusters and best 
practice sharing.  
 It is recommended  to consider access to the Internet as a basic human right  to foster the uptake 
of digital public infrastructures in underserved areas and for underserved people, and thus 
contribute to an inclusive digital society.  
 Establishing best practices and guidelines for inclusive and democratic access to digital 
commons , taking into consideration context-specific requirements, capacities and constraints. 
 Empowering local communities in the transition to digital through Digital Public 
Infrastructures (DPIs).  It is recommended to ensure connectivity of schools and vocational 
centers to digital means to empower the new generation, while augmenting capacities of 
community at large. Particular attention should be given to recalibrate the skill set of the current 
work force and empower women, economically and socially disadvantaged and other underserved 
sections of society.  
 Leveraging digitalization  to deliver more efficient, sustainable, affordable and inclusive local 
public services and urban environments. 
 Adopting  regulatory frameworks to facilitate inclusive digitalization and accommodate new 
practices. 
 Strengthening capacities and upskilling through contextualized and relatable information 
packages . It is recommended to make the digital information packages locally available through 
reliable and affordable internet access and by co-creating user friendly contents in local languages.
