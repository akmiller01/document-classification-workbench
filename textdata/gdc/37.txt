 2 Human Digital Security and Development  
 
This report is the outcome of the consultations which took place in the context of the Global 
Digital Compact (GDC) , organized by the United Nations Office of the Secretary -General's 
Envoy on Technology . 
 
The topic  “Human Digital Security and Development” is inspired by the UNU Macau 
institute's main research foci, which are  participation an d systems thinking, connected via 
collective intelligence and foresight . It is about reducing the threats and negative impacts 
while  enhancing the opportunities and benefits  to and for humans from the use and 
development of data and digital technologies.  Digital Human Security and Development  is 
about including, empowering, enhancing capabilities and securing/protecting a human -
centered approach  in the development and application of digital technologies.  
 
UNU Institute Macau has focused on  one health, clima te change, technology and ethics and 
the digital divide. Other areas included under the overall topic can include : cybersecurity, 
cyberbullying, women's access to technology, AI regulation, data management and 
knowledge creation, governance of the digital commons, digital identity and digital 
communities, and others.  
 
The following workflow was followed during the consultation process:  
 
 
 
1st online consultation:  13 Dec 2022  
2nd online consultation : 14 Dec 2022  
3rd online consultation : 14 March 2023

The following bullet points do not reflect the full richness of the discussions held in each of 
the working groups. They merely aim at drawing attention to issues under each of the topics.  
1. Connect all people to the internet, including all schools  
Membe rs: Abisoye Bello , Helani Galpaya , Karen Bet t  
 
Principles:   
• Affordability , inclusion, safety, speed, need to contribut e to people's wellbeing . 
Connectivity is a right.  Connectivity is not automatically leading to better educational 
outcomes.  Meaningful co nnectivity is a moving target, the KPI today will be different 
from KPIs in the future.    
• Digital literacy. Having schools connected doesn't guarantee better education. Only 
when teachers actively use the connectivity and resources online to put in the 
curriculum, the students can benefit from it, and the educational outcomes would be 
improved.   Funding policies must ensure this is achievable.  
• Human rights approach to data moving to connectivity - we cannot connect people if 
communities don't want to be con nected.     
• Focus on groups who are equity deserving, underrepresented in AI and digital 
development and governance : Gender, low -income, age, PWD, minorities. Their 
access needs to be considered.   
 
Commitments:    
• Remove policy barriers to for better connectivity. Governments need s to engage.  
• Financial investments in improved investments for better connectivity  and capacity to 
access and engage with new technologies .  
• Put digital infrastructure  in place to enable i nnovation . Start -ups and innovation 
should be enabled by  connectivity.   
• Engage civil society organizations, non -profit organizations involved in human rights, 
SDGs, climate action, food security, communities in connectivity improvement , 
digital infrastruct ure and access to AI and data.  
• Create accessible learning opportunities, creative outreach engagement and conduct 
continuous assessment of their impact;  
 
2. Protect data  
Members: Fabien Pfaender, Thy Try, Khairil  Zhafri  
 
Core principles  
• Data should be free, open and non -personal to the extent possible , or access made 
conditional to SDG, mission -oriented purposes .  
• Transparency and accountability in compliance with standards , rules  and digital 
economy partnerships focused on green and blue  economies .  
• Mechanisms for redress and remedy for violations should be in place.  
• Confidentiality, data sovereignty and the legality of collection, storage and 
distribution of data needs to depend on the type and purpose of the data related 
activity.  
 5  
Key commitments  
• Protection of data and protection of rights of citizens as data subjects.  
• Address the dilemma of how to balance competing interests: rights to data need to be 
protected but can also be used for the public good , by implementing mission -oriente d 
(SDGs, human rights) data collaborative models such as data trusts . 
• Put in place international standards on data protection and converge PDP laws.  
• Institutionalize discourse processes and dialogues on the use of open data, especially 
when there are conflicting interests, e.g., individual rights vs public/national interests.  
• Put in place interministerial, multidisciplinary workgroups that are enabled  to gather 
data, assess the impact of AI on women, and of women on AI, and setting concrete 
targets to drive gender balance  
 
3. Apply human rights online   
Members : Bryan, Soraj  Hongladarom , Malavika Jayaram , Patrick Pan g, Cara  Antonaccio , 
Tomasz Janowski, Sophie Hoogenboom , Stephanie Santos  
 
Core Principles  
• Data should be free, private and secure.  
• Access to common data resources through a data community.  
• Right to be forgotten.  
• Dignity in online identities.  
• UDHR – Universal Declaration on Online Human Rights, fundamental (human) rights 
in the digital space  
• Anonymization of personal data  
• Security - free from harassment  
• Fair and equal digital education;  those unable to access online education should not be 
harmfully affected by their lack of knowledge stemming from the online world.  
• #1City authorities, not technology corporations, are driving smart city initiatives, on 
behalf of city residents.   
• #2 Government automation initiatives should be human -centered, they should not 
compromize on human or social rights to achieve economic or efficiency gains.   
• #3 Ensure that  people from all parts of the world have an equal ability to access the 
internet and make use of its benefits in order to exercise their human rights.   
• #4 The use of public resources to further short -term political goals by sawing division 
in the digital space and beyond is illegitimate.            
 
Key Commitments  
• Internet governance : provide access and enable engagement for different stakeholders  
and aim at detecting and preventing dis/misinformation without restricting human 
rights  
• Improve  digital literacy; and expand concepts of ethics to include social, economic, 
political, cultural and legal impacts of AI  
• Implement g lobal agreements on digital inheritance and the righ t to be forgotten.  
• Materiality of the digital world .  Assess the environmental and health effects  and 
digital labor issues ( e.g., outsourcing of traumatic labors like content moderation to 
 6 global south); use of resources in one locale (electricity/minerals ) that are beneficial 
to another locale.  
• #1 Smart city governance bodies to include authorities, businesses and citizens; 
ongoing monitoring of smart city outcomes against expected benefits and targets; 
digital channels for citizens to voice their opinions  and concerns   
• #2 Automation outcomes, particularly on substantive issues, should be subject to 
human review; automation decisions must rely on well -governed, trusted data; 
automation initiatives should be supported publicly; they should be part of an 
overarching digital strategy  
• #3 Define what the right to access and benefit from the internet would entail; how this 
can be implemented (education/regulation) and monitored and by who.  
• #4 Countering top -down digital polarization by bottom -up digital solidarity; creating a 
sense of shared fate; socializing divided groups to work on common projects; 
delegitimizing the use of public funds to implement divide -and-conquer    
 
4. Accountability for discrimination and misleading content  
Members:  
Jia Wang, Ke run Sun, Irene Kitsara,  Joyee S. Chatterjee

particular c aution about monopolization by the private sector  
• Ensure the a ccountability of private company behaviour; similar accountability 
approach like in natural resource extraction.  
 7 • Governments are not sufficient in  regulating AI, Malaysia: insufficient resources in

digital infrastructure, digital silk road...) and adopting digital infrastructure from third 
countri es.
