Inputs to the Global Digital Compact
Proposals presented in each of the topics defined by the consultation:
1. Connecting all people to the Internet, including all schools
a) Core Principles:
•Internet access must be universal so that it becomes a tool for human and social  
development,  thereby  contributing  to  the  formation  of  an  inclusive  and  
nondiscriminatory society, for the benefit of all;
•Access to the Internet and digital infrastructure should be affordable;
•Access and connectivity should be meaningful in all levels;
•The fair, rational, equitable, and efficient allocation and use of radio spectrum and  
satellite orbits are essential and key to connectivity;
•Schools are key spaces to be focused by public policy processes in order to  
advance meaningful access and connectivity;
•Multistakeholder dialogues and south-south cooperation are key to advance the  
connectivity infrastructure and access landscape.
b) Key Commitment/ Pledges/ Actions:
•The fair availability of radio spectrum and satellite orbits to provide connectivity all  
over the world might be targeted by the specialized United Nations body, the  
International Telecommunication Union (ITU);
•Stakeholders should commit to initiatives to develop and foster digital literacy and  
the critical use of technologies, including in education;
•Digital capacity building initiatives should gain more focus and resources, as a tool  
to drive sustainable development;
•Stakeholders should work together to build, improve and expand available digital  
Infrastructure;
•Digital divide continues to be a persistent and serious issue in several parts of the  
world and should be tackled by collaborative frameworks between States and the  
multistakeholder digital ecosystem;
•In the context of the data economy it is crucial to tackle the challenge of the  
increasing use of technological platforms in education by consolidating frameworks  
for the fair governance of infrastructure and data, with transparency, accountability  
and safeguards for users' rights;
•The increasing use of technology in education should continue to be incentivized in  
a critical approach, by the promotion of digital literacy and also policy frameworks to  
protect user data, and to raise awareness of impacted people.
2. Avoid internet fragmentation
a) Core Principles:
Global Digital Compact – Inputs from CGI.br 3

Inputs to the Global Digital Compact
•Bear in mind that there are principles that must be preserved to maintain a global  
open and equally accessible Internet environment, taking into account that other  
discussions may benefit from a coordinated action. The global network needs some  
level of uniformity necessary to its smooth and fair operation to all. However, at the  
same time, the world also needs to preserve the sovereignty and diversities of  
States  and  peoples.  These  are  not  incompatible  expectations  and  may  walk  
together towards a more valuable and cooperative global digital ecosystem;
•The stability, security and overall functionality of the network must be actively  
preserved through the adoption of technical measures that are consistent with  
international standards and encourage the adoption of best practices;
•Free access to information and services is a fundamental right and should be  
guaranteed for all groups and peoples.
b) Key Commitment/ Pledges/ Actions:
•States should seek collaboration in order to further shared frameworks that enable  
countries to safeguard their sovereignty as well as cooperate in common matters,  
being able to deploy solutions that enable legal interoperability in the global level;
•All stakeholders should prevent and mitigate any actions to break or negatively alter  
the uniformity and cohesiveness of the Internet that may fragment the network and  
pose negative effects to societies and users, due to the unequal access to services,  
goods and information by populations in different countries;
•States  should  commit  to  protect  core  values  and  the  core  functions  and  
technologies that shape the global Internet as a unique, open, democratic space to  
promote  human  development,  following  previous  important  processes  and  
documents,  such  as  the  NETmundial  declaration,  the  principles  of  the  Global  
Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, and others;
•States  should  avoid  any  shutdowns  and  blocking  to  services  and  information  
offered through the Internet, especially when these shutdowns and blockings harm  
fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression and freedom of association.
3. Protect data
a) Core Principles:
•People’s privacy and personal data protection should be guaranteed in all levels  
and actions, and by all stakeholders, and should be also integrated to national  
frameworks;
•In an evolving global landscape of more efforts to access cross-border user data of  
different types, there should be a fair balance between legal interoperability and the  
protection of users;
•Coordinated global efforts towards regulatory harmonization of privacy and data  
protection should have a human-centered approach and focus on the benefit of  
individuals worldwide.

b) Key Commitment/ Pledges/ Actions:
•States should cooperate with other stakeholders to enhance capacities to 
guarantee privacy and protection of personal data;
•States should share information and best practices to fight data exfiltration and 
exploitation by malicious actors;
•States should increase confidence-building measures and pursue strategies to 
make cross-border data sharing more efficient and fair at all levels;
•States and the multistakeholder digital ecosystem should cooperate in order to 
address conflict of jurisdictions and legislations, as so to provide a global full-
fledged set of protections to users.
4. Apply human rights online
a) Core Principles:
•Human rights must apply both online and offline;
•The protection of human rights on the digital realm depends on the maintenance of  
an open and safe Internet;
•Adequate  application  of  human  rights  online  also  depends  on  consistent  
transparency and accountability frameworks;
•The  application  of  human  rights  online  should  take  into  account  diversity  and  
minority groups’ specificities, and aim to be inclusive;
•Capacity building on  accessibility and diversity issues such as gender and race  
inequalities is key to consolidate the application of Human Rights online.
b) Key Commitment/ Pledges/ Actions:
•States should work together with all stakeholders to consolidate shared norms,  
principles and frameworks for the safeguarding of human rights on the Internet and  
the global digital ecosystem as a whole;
•Efforts should especially focus on the protection of minorities and promotion of  
rights for women and girls, indigenous and black communities, LGBTQIA+ groups,  
older people and people with disabilities, and other vulnerable and marginalized  
groups.
5. Accountability for discrimination and misleading content
a) Core Principles:
•Disinformation and misleading content need to be recognized as elements which  
may lead to the decrease of trust on the Internet and digital technologies;
•Transparency  and  Accountability  measures  should  take  political  and  cultural  
realities into account in order to build consistent frameworks; 
Global Digital Compact – Inputs from CGI.br 5

Inputs to the Global Digital Compact
•The  fight  against  discrimination  and  misleading  content  should  be  a  
multistakeholder coordinated effort and take into account all the diversity of issues,  
actors, and regions;
•States have an important role to play regarding minimal cross-industry rules that  
should be defined in a multistakeholder and transparent way and adopted by private  
actors in a willingly and smooth manner;
•Artificial Intelligence technologies and the use of algorithms have added complexity  
to the process of identifying and distinguishing between human  action and those  
originated from  automated systems;
•As a general principle, actions to counter illicit activity on the Internet should firstly  
aim at those directly responsible for such activities, in accordance with national  
frameworks and legislations.
b) Key Commitment/ Pledges/ Actions:
•Intermediary liability rules should aim at the updated dynamics of the Internet but  
still protect its core characteristics, such as the protections to online freedom of  
expression, access to knowledge and others;
•Hate  speech  and  extremist  and  violent  content  should  be  tackled,  as  well  as  
misinformation and content that threatens democracy, with fair and reasonable  
frameworks that mitigate risks and negative impacts, at the same time that protect  
Internet core benefits;
•Continued  multistakeholder  dialogues  on  these  topics  should  be  permanently  
sought to leverage proposals and solutions.
6. Regulation of artificial intelligence
a) Core Principles:
•Artificial Intelligence should be recognized as an emergent technology that has a  
true potential to transform multiple social dynamics in both positive and harmful  
ways;
•As a disruptive technology, Artificial Intelligence needs to be leveraged to drive the  
evolution of the digital ecosystem with innovation and responsibility;
•A  holistic,  ethically  responsible  and  human-centered  approach  should  guide 
discussions about Artificial Intelligence and its implementation and impacts.
b) Key Commitment/ Pledges/ Actions:
•The development and use of Artificial Intelligence should be undergone through  
multiple governance debates, within multistakeholder dialogues, in order to expand  
views on its study, development, deployment, and risks’ mitigation, and also caring  
for the protection of fundamental rights;
•Such  dialogues  should  consider  permanent  review  of  capacities  needed  to  
overcome challenges that may arise;
Global Digital Compact – Inputs from CGI.br 6

Inputs to the Global Digital Compact
•Concepts such as ethics, privacy and security by design, as well as consistent  
transparency and accountability mechanisms should be considered as core values  
to  embed  within  Artificial  Intelligence  development,  standardization,  and  
governance.
7. Digital commons as a global public good
a) Core Principles:
•The Internet and the digital ecosystem should continue to be framed as a key tool to  
foster global social development;
•The use of the Internet must be driven by the principles of freedom of expression,  
individual privacy and the respect for human rights, recognizing them as essential to  
the preservation of a fair and democratic society;
•Internet governance must be exercised in a transparent, multilateral and democratic  
manner, with the participation of the various sectors of society, thereby preserving  
and encouraging its character as a collective creation;
•Cultural diversity must be respected and preserved and its expression must be  
stimulated, without the imposition of beliefs, customs or values;
•Internet governance must promote the continuous development and widespread  
dissemination of new technologies and models for  access and use;
•Filtering or traffic privileges must meet ethical and technical criteria only, excluding  
any  political,  commercial,  religious  and  cultural  factors  or  any  other  form  of  
discrimination or preferential treatment;
•All action taken against illicit activity on the network must be aimed at those directly  
responsible for such activities,  and not at the means of access and transport,  
always upholding the fundamental principles of freedom, privacy and the respect for  
human rights;
•Digital inclusion and access to inform ation / knowledge should be regarded as  
important tools for social development, in a human-centered perspective;
•Open  Internet  and  open  interoperable  digital  technologies  are  key  to  the  
development of multiple and globally available services and goods.
b) Key Commitment/ Pledges/ Actions:
•Internet, ICTs, and digital infrastructure and tools in general should be in the center  
of multistakeholder discussions when it comes to advance processes such as the  
2030 Agenda for sustainable development and the SDGs;
•Digital platforms may actively take measures to tackle recognized illicit content on  
the Internet, taking into account their capabilities and responsibilities within the  
scope of their networks and activities, as well as business models.
8. Other areas
Global Digital Compact – Inputs from CGI.br 7

The Brazilian Internet Steering Committee – CGI.br
Inputs to the Global Digital Compact
Specify area: Global cooperation and relationship with other processes and arenas
a) Core Principles:
•There is a need to reinforce open and inclusive multistakeholder dialogues to build  
solutions for digital cooperation , following the success of the history of Internet  
governance as a multistakeholder ecosystem;
•The Internet Governance Forum  – IGF is a valuable forum for the discussion of  
“public policy issues related to key elements of Internet governance in order to  
foster  the  sustainability,  robustness,  security,  stability  and  development  of  the  
Internet”,  as  mandated  by  the  Tunis  Agenda,  promoting  cooperation  among  
different actors in a global perspective. The IGF could have a more prominent role  
in the follow-up of the GDC, for instance on the continuous assessment of results  
obtained by countries and other relevant stakeholders regarding the GDC goals.  
The National and Regional IGFs would build a formidable network of resources to  
help in this task;
•The Internet Governance Forum may play the role of a convergent arena for digital  
policy debates, being the main space for the discussions over the Global Digital  
Compact debate and implementation. To enable that, the IGF may benefit from  
some improvements, many already envisioned by previous processes such as the  
High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation and the IGF Plus model. For example, the  
IGF  could  be  framed  as  a  permanent  digital  cooperation  arena,  thus  needing  
adequate human and financial resources. Other than that, it is very important to  
improve inclusion and diversity in the participation of stakeholders, professional  
fundraising structures to enable long-term planning, and more tangible outcomes  
such  as  policy-oriented  activities  that  can  deliver  policy  recommendations  and  
concrete solutions for digital issues worldwide. Additionally, as discussed during the  
digital cooperation debates, the IGF needs more channels for cooperation and new  
modes for disclosing information, as well as outreach and engagement practices  
able to reach diverse stakeholders, including policy and decision-makers;
•We believe in the importance of the Internet Governance Forum to achieve better  
understanding between stakeholders in order to advance Internet governance and  
the digital agenda worldwide. It is of utmost importance to preserve and evolve this  
arena in terms of improving policy discussions, recommendations, and also means  
for governments and other stakeholders to be able to collect ideas, information and  
concrete solutions for the most pressing digital issues of our time, especially in light  
of recent discussions and processes such as Digital Cooperation and the Global  
Digital Compact, or even the WSIS+20 Review. The IGF is a very important space  
for stakeholders to meet and discuss in order to advance these and other important  
digital agendas. We hope the Global Digital Compact take that into account;
•We believe in the importance of having a stable, trustworthy and resilient digital  
infrastructure, technically backed by a strong network of experts and a diversity of

stakeholders as means for advancing and strengthening the local ecosystems, and  
also  to  protect  human  rights  and  fulfill  demands  of  human  and  technological  
resources;
•Environment,  sustainability  and  climate  change  are  rising  hot  topics  within  the  
global digital agenda. There is a need to foster a digital technologies' ecosystem to  
contribute to the mitigation of climate change effects and to pursue the Sustainable  
Development Goals agenda;
•In line with the Brazilian Computer Society – SBC's Manifesto “Digital Technologies  
for the Environment ”2, we believe in the need to foster national robust digital policies  
and  a  coordinated  global  strategy  in  order  to  tackle  climate  challenge  and  to  
contribute  to  the  green  economy  transition,  grounded  on  a  transdisciplinary  
approach to define a new vision of knowledge above disciplines.
b) Key Commitment/ Pledges/ Actions:
•The Global Digital Compact and other related initiatives should always build upon  
previous very well succeeded processes, such as WSIS, NETmundial, the HLPDC,  
and others, and have the Internet Governan ce Forum as a key arena for debate  
and cooperation;
•It is also of utmost importance that the GDC moves along with discussions for the  
WSIS+20 review, in order to avoid overlapping and contradictions between them;
•The Internet Governance ecosystem and the digital environment in a broader sense  
follow a fast changing dynamic, and it is difficult to keep all their elements at the  
same pace. It is necessary to find a balance between, from one side, demands for  
participation, representation and diversity, and from the other side, rules, norms,  
work plans and clear terms of reference that help the model to reach the goals  
sought by the ongoing proposed process;
•The WSIS process and all its elements are very important for the developments in  
the digital ecosystem as a whole, being a core guidance for thinking of how to  
improve cooperation in the field. In this sense, the second review of the WSIS  
mandate is also approaching quickly and it is very important for us to reflect on how  
to appropriately advance the work done since the last review in 2015. One of the  
great concerns is how to fit in this review a reflection upon emerging technologies  
that  grew  in  relevance  since  the  last  review.  WSIS  mandate  should  take  into  
account the digital ecosystem and its developments, also framing that in a scalable  
way that can fit brand-new issues and challenges, and also means for cooperation.  
The Global Digital Compact could be tailored to also reflect these issues observed  
in the WSIS process , in a way that ensures full consistency between the two 
processes and do not preempt  the WSIS+20 review ;
•Ever expanding digital technologies and services also have a significant impact on  
climate change and the sustainability agenda, and this must be addressed on a  
holistic basis. It is also very important to recognize that, despite improvements in

recent years, large digital divides still exist, both within and between countries, and  
also between men and women. We note that divides are often closely linked to  
education levels and existing inequalities, and we recognize that further divides can  
emerge  in  the  future  because  of  new  technologies,  thus  slowing  sustainable  
development for all. Billions of citizens in the world still need to be connected, and  
many more to have a meaningful and affordable connection to the Internet and to  
digital  technologies  and  services.  We  must  also  recognize  that  differences  in  
individuals’ capabilities to both use and create content and services on the Internet  
represent a knowledge divide that perpetuates inequality;
•We must not forget the main characteristic that led the evolution of the Internet  
throughout its history: innovation. The Internet and the digital ecosystem must be  
preserved  and  leveraged  as  a  key  catalyst  for  innovation  as  the  basis  for  
development,  addressing  past,  present,  and  future  concerns  and  technologies,  
emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and so on, in order to extract  
benefits for people and drive the development of our world with responsibility,  
fairness, equality, and opportunities for all. All these aspects are also key when  
looking  ahead  to  the  Global  Digital  Compact,  but  also  to  bear  in  mind  the  
importance  of  the  Digital  Agenda  to  fulfill  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  
(SDGs);
•Seconding the proposals from the above mentioned Manifesto from the Brazilian  
Computer Society – SBC, we highlight the importance of defining robust digital  
technology policies that enable openness, integrity and interoperability of systems,  
as well as greater global cooperation on the field;
•Creation,  promotion  and  expansion  of  funding  initiatives  for  Research  and  
Development in digital technologies for the environment is key to advance the  
Sustainable Development Goals, including with relation to emerging technologies  
such as Artificial Intelligence.
