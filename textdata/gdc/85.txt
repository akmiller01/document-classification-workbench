 Joint Submission to the Consultation on the Global Digital Compact  
 
We welcome the UN Secretary General’s call through the report “Our Common 
Agenda” proposing to adopt a Global Digital Compact during the Summit of the Future 
in September 2024.  
 
The Global Digital Compact is expected to “outline shared principles for an op en, free 
and secure digital future for all” covering issues related to digital connectivity, avoiding 
Internet fragmentation, providing people with options as to how their data is used, 
application of human rights online, and promoting a trustworthy Intern et by introducing 
accountability criteria for discrimination and misleading content. If adopted, the GDC 
will have an impact in the lives of all and therefore it is important that the GDC adopts 
a multistakeholder process not only during the consultative p hase but also during the 
decision making, implementation and monitoring phase.  
 
Further, the GDC should not only recommend guiding principles for the Internet of the 
future, but also identify and lay down clear actions to achieve these objectives and 
goals . 
 
1. Connect all people to the internet, including all schools  
Connecting the nearly 2.7 billion people should be the topmost  priority. To ensure that, 
there is a need to encourage innovative approaches to connectivity including 
community networks, appr opriate spectrum allocation, reducing spectrum auction 
prices, IPv6 deployment, etc. and promote research and development to create 
affordable devices and technologies. Universal Obligation of funds needs to be used 
creatively in order to facilitate more p eople to be connected.  
Resilient and secure digital infrastructure is crucial for digital inclusion. Governments 
should encourage investment to protect and promote digital infrastructure and  ensure 
reliable connectivity and speed. They should also avoid I nternet shutdowns.  
Universal access should respect human rights and ensure the Internet is both 
accessible and safe for all. Multilingual internet, addressing issues of accessibility 
online for the differently abled should be a priority . Concepts of gender equality, 
inclusion, and women’s rights and protection should be encouraged.  
Exchange of best practices and success stories should be encouraged so that they 
can be replicated elsewhere or customised to suit the local requirements and the IGF 
should be promoted as the platform  for such discussions by the GDC.  
In this information age access to the Internet for information and education in schools 
is crucial. Governments should partner with private sector and technical institutions to 
ensure that the schools especially in remote  and rural  locati ons are provided with 
adequate internet bandwidth, proper devices in keeping with the  increasing bandwidth 
Joint Submission to the Consultation on the Global Digital Compact                                                  Page | 2  
 requirements, so that students can ac cess online classes and  information 
conveniently. Adequate Bandwidth for schools should be quantified to  enable latest 
technology access for students.  Ensuring regular electricity service at least during the 
school time is critical. For that, the use of solar power ma y be encouraged for 
sustainability. Providing capacity building to teachers and students on how to 
maximise the benefit of the Internet while safe surfing is important.  
Finally , the GDC should acknowledge that it was the cooperative, interoperable, open,  
and bottom -up approach that created this dynamic, resilient Internet, and that this 
same cooperative approach provides us with the tools to extend Internet access to all 
people.  
2. Internet governance / Avoid internet fragmentation  
Over the last 3 decades, m ultistakeholder efforts have been effective in preventing 
Internet fragmentation around the world by promoting the development and use of 
globally accepted Internet standards and protocols.  
 
An example of such efforts is the coordination and governance of  the Internet naming 
and numbering systems, that allow users around the world to access the same content 
and services without any barriers or restrictions. Numerous individuals and 
organisations, comprising both governmental agencies and intergovernmental 
organisations, have contributed significantly to this coordination. Their concerted 
efforts have been instrumental in maintaining the Internet's open, global, and 
interoperable nature, while ensuring its stability and security.  
 
The organisations and commu nities that have evolved around these coordination 
systems, have built an inclusive, transparent and accountable governance framework 
that has helped to build trust in the global Internet ecosystem. Active coordination 
should continue to be promoted and su pported to ensure healthy Internet governance.  
 
The Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and its ecosystem play a pivotal role in fostering 
dialogue and multistakeholder participation on Internet public policy issues and has 
strengthened the Internet coordinati on ecosystem over the years. Hence, the IGF is a 
suitable platform to support the implementation of the GDC principles and 
commitments. Efforts should continue to be made to strengthen the IGF.  
 
Local multistakeholder processes such as the National and Regional Initiatives of the 
IGF work well and additional efforts could be made to aggregate these initiatives into 
regional and global fora. Additionally, various multistakeholder national, regional , and 
global youth initiatives, such as national Youth IGFs, are working towards meaningful 
youth empowerment and engagement in decision -making processes. More active 
efforts to integrate such initiatives will ensure young voices in the digital public poli cy 
and technology development space.

Stakeholders should work together towards avoiding fragmentation. In this regard, we 
support the work that is currently being done in the IGF Policy Network on Internet 
Fragmentation (PNIF). The PNIF was a community i nitiative launched by a 
multistakeholder coalition of civil society, business and technical community 
organisations to raise awareness of the technical, policy, legal and regulatory 
measures and actions that pose a risk to the open, interconnected and inte roperable 
Internet.  
 
We appreciate the efforts of the GDC public consultations. We encourage the ongoing 
GDC process to be more open, multistakeholder and inclusive, promoting active 
dialogue and robust discussion, which are key elements for reaching bette r 
agreements and understandings.  
 
3. Protect data  
 
To enable the free flow of information while ensuring the protection of sensitive data, 
it is important to have a proactive and collaborative approach to addressing cross -
border data flow barriers. That is why we support the concept of Data Free Flow with 
Trust.  
 
There are numerous barriers that can impede the transfer of data across borders, such 
as data privacy regulations, data localization requirements, and security concerns -
which might result in fu rther aggravating Internet fragmentation. To overcome these 
barriers, it is important to implement robust security measures, such as encryption and 
access controls, to protect the data being transferred. Additionally, adopting 
internationally recognized da ta protection standards and certifications can help to 
ensure compliance with data privacy regulations across different jurisdictions.  
 
4. Regulation of artificial intelligence  
 
Some regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) might ensure that it is deve loped and 
deployed in a manner that aligns with the values and interests of the human kind. 
However, such regulation will only be possible with good governance in place, as it 
provides the necessary framework for transparent, accountable, and inclusive 
decision-making. Good governance involves ensuring that decision -making processes 
are guided by the needs and aspirations of all stakeholders. It is also conducive to 
innovation, while safeguarding against the risks and challenges posed by the rapid 
advanceme nt of AI. By promoting good governance, we can help ensure that the 
regulation of AI is effective and promotes the public good, while minimising the risks 
and challenges associated with its development and deployment.  
 
When it comes to the governance of ar tificial intelligence (AI), many of the lessons 
learned from Internet governance can be applied. Like the Internet, AI has the potential 
Joint Submission to the Consultation on the Global Digital Compact                                                  Page | 4  
 to shape our society in profound ways, and it is important that its development and 
deployment are guided by principles  that reflect the values of our society. Multi -
stakeholder engagement is critical in this regard, as it enables diverse perspectives 
and expertise to be brought to the table, ensuring that the development of AI is guided 
by the needs and aspirations of all  stakeholders. Additionally, transparency, 
accountability, and inclusivity are essential to ensuring that the governance of AI is 
conducted in a manner that is fair, equitable, and consistent with the principles of 
democratic governance. By learning from t he lessons of Internet governance, we can 
help ensure that the governance of AI is conducted in a manner that promotes the 
public good, while addressing the complex challenges that are sure to arise.  
 
Regulation should be balanced between targeting the cha llenges faced by widespread 
adoption of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies with protecting 
people online and ensuring human rights are respected. A regulatory sandbox in 
artificial intelligence (AI) with a multistakeholder approach has  numerous benefits that 
make it a valuable tool for promoting innovation while protecting the interests of all 
stakeholders. By allowing innovators to experiment with new AI technologies in a 
controlled environment, a regulatory sandbox can help to acceler ate the development 
of new solutions and business models. At the same time, it can provide regulators with 
valuable insights into the potential risks and benefits of these technologies, allowing 
them to develop more informed policies and regulations. A mul tistakeholder approach, 
which involves the participation of stakeholders from government, industry, academia, 
and civil society, can help to ensure that the sandbox reflects a diversity of 
perspectives and interests. This approach can also foster collabora tion and dialogue 
among stakeholders, leading to more inclusive and effective policy outcomes. 
Ultimately, a regulatory sandbox in AI with a multistakeholder approach can help to 
create a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem for AI innovation and deploy ment, 
benefiting society as a whole.  
 
In addition, cross national efforts should be explored in finding solutions. This includes 
balancing and relating AI principles and guidelines to universal human rights norms 
and harmonising between the different globa l regulatory frameworks on AI.
