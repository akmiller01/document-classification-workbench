TRADE UNIONS KEY MESSAGES!
Global Digital Compact
Trade Unions are calling on governments and international institutions to implement a NEW
SOCIAL CONTACT with 575 million new and decent jobs with just transitions and the
formalisation of one billion of informal workers by 2030 to meet the promises of the SDGs.
For technological change to serve the common
good, investments and regulatory frameworks
must be designed and implemented in order to ensure access to technology for all, including
addressing global digital divide, and reinforce fundamental ILO standards and other
internationally recognised human
rights in a rapidly changing world.
Governments should be supportive of collective bargaining and social dialogue, in
accordance with the ILO Conventions.
Governing Technology
e
We call on governments to implement policies and regulations governing technology,
data and deployment of algorithms that are employment- and worker-friendly and
ensure privacy and people’s control over and ownership of their own data.
eWe call on governments and international institutions to put in place proactive
digitalisation policies and strategies including for improving access to public services.
eWe
call for national
and
international
frameworks
that require
prior negotiations with
unions concerning the introduction of new technologies in enterprises.
eGovernments must not ratify trade agreements with provisions that limit the ability of
governments to regulate the digital economy.
eWe oppose any liberalisation of international digital trade that could prevent States from
regulating the social and fiscal practices of digital operators.
eWe demand that large tech monopolies be broken up to ensure fair competition and an
end to monopoly power.
eWe call for tax reform to ensure tech companies pay their fair share of tax in the country
where profits are generated.
