and
their
lands
on
which
we
live
and
work,
recognizing
that
our
collaboration
emerges
from
a
commitment
from
each
one
of
us
to
our
relatives,
communities,
and
constituents.
Our
work
is
anchored
by
our
shared
values
and
goals
around
Indigenous
Peoples’
rights
to,
interests
in,
and
relationships
with
their
data,

who
came
before
us,
and
youth
who
will
continue
keeping
and
sharing
our
knowledges
with
generations
to
come.

Digital
technologies
empower
billions
of
individuals
worldwide,
creating
seemingly
endless
opportunities,
and
advancing
social
progress
(UN,
2021a).
The
Global
Digital
Compact
(GDC)
processes
claim
to
“
outline
shared
principles
for
an
open,
free
and
secure
digital
future
for
all
”
to
achieve
universal
connectivity
by
2030
(UN,
2022;
UN
2023).
In
other
words,
the
GDC
acknowledges
the
relevance
of
diversity
in
pursuit
of
ensuring
meaningful
consultation
from
all
stakeholders,
rights
and
titleholders.
Globally
,
however ,
approximately
2.9
billion
people
are
excluded
from
the
digital
tech
world
(ITU,
2021).
Yet
all
of
humanity
is
impacted
by
the
decisions
made
within
these
digital
ecosystems,
highlighted
by
the
digital
communication
discrimination
that
occurred
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
(UN,
2021a).
We
applaud
the
UN
Secretary
General’ s
inclusion
of
the
proposed
Global
Digital
Compact
(GDC)
as
part
of
Our
Common
Agenda
and
encourage
that
it
supports
Indigenous
Peoples
as
rights
and
titleholders
under
the
United
Nations
Declaration
on
the
Rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples.
As
technology
continues
to
advance
at
an
accelerated
rate,
the
ways
in
which
data
are
governed
and
managed
are
essential
to
achieve
digital
equity .
Moreover ,
there
will
be
an
increased
reliance
on
data
in
the
digital
age
when
it
comes
to
government
policy
and
decision-making
(Walter
et
al.,
2021).
The
GDC
should
embody
a
sustained
commitment
centered
not
only
on
human
rights
but
Indigenous
Peoples’
rights,
ensuring
that
all
voices
are
included.
Global
digital
inclusion
is
necessary
to
develop
and
advance
knowledge
societies
and
“bridge
the
digital
divide”
(UN,
2021a).
In
particular ,
accelerating
progress
toward
digital
inclusion
for
all
must
include
Indigenous
Peoples
(UN,
2021a).
Ther efor e,
we
ar e
calling
on
all
member
states
to
prioritize
the
support
of
Indigenous
Data
Sover eignty
(IDSov)
and
the
integration
of
Indigenous
Data
Governance
(IDGov)
into
the
GDC
fr om
its
inception
.
It
is
important
to
note
that
IDSov
is
exercised
by
Indigenous
rights
and
title
holders,
thus
exclusively
operationalized
by
Indigenous
Peoples.
Whereas
non-Indigenous
Peoples
can
support
IDSov
through
IDGov ,
the
activating
agent
that
can
be
institutionally
practiced
across
all
peoples.
Doing
so
serves
to
increase
Indigenous
Peoples’
access
to,
use
of,
and
benefit
from,
data
and
technology
while
enhancing
their
rights
to
self-determine
how
to
govern,
steward,
and
share
their
data
(Carroll
et
al.,
2019).
Existing
principles
within
the
open
data
movement
include
the
FAIR
Guiding
Principles
(Findable,
Accessible,
Interoperable,
Reusable),
the
CARE
Principles
for
Indigenous
Data
Governance
(Collective
benefit,
Authority
to
control,
Responsibility ,
Ethics),
and
the
TRUST
Principles
(Transparency ,
Responsibility ,
User
Focus,
Sustainability ,
Technology)
(Carroll
et
al.,
2020;
FAIR,
2016;
Lin
et
al.,
2020)
(See
Figure
1).

Figure
1:
FAIR
Guiding
Principles
&
CARE
Principles
for
Indigenous
Data
Governance
(GIDA,
2022b).
Developed
for
data
sharing,
the
FAIR
Guiding
Principles
prioritize
reusing
digital
assets,
but
lack
ethics
and
protections
for
Indigenous
sovereignty
involved
in
the
making
of
the
data
(Haak,
2020),
digital
infrastructures,
and
data
policies
and
practices
(Carroll
et
al.,
2021b;
GIDA,
2022b).
On
the
other
hand,
the
CARE
Principles
are
people
and
purpose-oriented,
thus
reflecting
the
integral
and
inherent
relationships
involved
with
Indigenous
data,
with
the
aim
of
advancing
Indigenous
governance
(Carroll
et
al.,
2020).
Data
related/linked
to
Indigenous
Peoples
must
be
controlled
accordingly ,
by
Indigenous
Peoples.
This
can
be
pursued
through
the
implementation
of
the
CARE
Principles
(Carroll
et
al.,
2022).
Moreover ,
the
TRUST
Principles
are
designed
to
increase
the
“digital
repository
trustworthiness”
by
ensuring
best
practices
are
implemented
(Lin
et
al.,
2020).
Integrating
the
FAIR,
CARE
and
TRUST
Principles
is
necessary
to
achieve
digital
equity
in
a
good
way
.
Thus,
to
close
the
digital
divide,
the
GDC
must
include
training
sessions
that
enhance
digital
inclusion
to
achieve
equitable
access
to
the
global
information
society
(UN,
2021a).
Technology
cannot
replace
Indigenous
ways
of
knowing,
but
it
can
help
to
compile
a
rich,
historical
archive
to
record
and
preserve
knowledges
for
future
generations
(UN,
2021a).
To
effectively
and
genuinely
integrate
these
principles,
IDSov
must
be
at
the
forefront
of
the
GDC.
This
integration
would
support
Indigenous
rights
and
promote
digital
connectivity ,
outlined
within
the
United
Nations
Declaration
on
the
Rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples
(UNDRIP)
(UN,
2007).
There
are
multiple
UNDRIP
articles
relevant
to
IDGov ,
such
as
Article
8.1,
Article
11.1,
Article
12.1,
and
so
on.
Specifically ,
Article
18
and
Article
31,
stipulate
the
“right
to
participate
in
decision-making
in
matters
which
would
affect
their
rights”
and
the
“right
to

maintain,
control,
protect
and
develop
their
cultural
heritage,
traditional
knowledge
and
traditional
cultural
expressions,
as
well
as
the
manifestations
of
their
sciences,
technologies
and
cultures”
(UN,
2007).
These
Articles
epitomize
Indigenous
Data
Sover eignty
(IDSov),
which
“r efers
to
the
right
of
Indigenous
Peoples
to
govern
the
collection,
ownership,
and
application
of
data
about
Indigenous
communities,
peoples,
lands,
and
r esour ces”
(Rainie
et
al.,
2019).
The
inclusion
of
IDSov
in
the
GDC
will
defend
and
extend
global
digital
rights.
In
particular ,
the
UN’s
power
has
the
capacity
to
forge
consensus
on
global
digital
issues
from
gender
violence,
discrimination,
racism,
youth
exclusion,
and
ultimately
digital
colonialism.
A
timely
and
transparent
communication
with
all
stakeholders,
rights
and
title
holders
throughout
the
process
of
the
GDC
development
must
be
inclusive
not
only
of
the
6
official
languages
of
the
United
Nations,
but
must
be
transferable
to
protect
and
support
Indigenous
languages
and
end
the
monopolization
of
English
in
digital
spaces.
1.
Connect
all
people
to
the
Internet,
including
all
schools
Indigenous
communities
face
several
challenges
when
it
comes
to
Internet
connectivity .
One
of
the
most
significant
challenges
is
the
lack
of
infrastructure
and
resources
in
Indigenous
territories
and
remote
areas.
Indigenous
Peoples
living
in
rural
or
remote
areas
often
lack
access
to
the
necessary
infrastructure
needed
for
reliable
Internet
connectivity ,
including
fiber
optic
cables
and
cell
towers.
In
addition,
high
costs
associated
with
Internet
connectivity
also
pose
a
significant
challenge
for
Indigenous
communities.
Many
individuals
and
families
living
on
Indigenous
territories
and/or
in
remote
areas
may
not
have
the
financial
means
to
afford
high-speed
Internet
or
even
basic
equipment
such
as
computers
or
smartphones.
The
lack
of
infrastructure
and
high
cost
of
Internet
connectivity
can
make
it
difficult
for
individuals
to
access
education,
job
opportunities,
and
essential
services
(Duarte
et
al.,
2021).
To
address
these
inequities,
it
is
important
to
consult
with
Indigenous
Peoples
to
determine
what
Internet
access
and
sustainable
connectivity
mean
to
them.
An
excellent
model
for
future
collaborative
engagement
processes
is
the
Indigenous
Connectivity
Summit,
which
brought
Indigenous
Peoples
together
to
explore,
define,
and
“develop
their
own
connectivity
solutions”
(Campbell,
2018,
p.
3).
Recommendations
from
the
summit
included:
1.
Creative
connectivity
solutions
that
focus
on
sustainability.
2.
An
enabling
environment
of
supportive
policies,
funding
opportunities
and
public
education.
3.
Capacity
building
and
education
within
communities.
4.
Easier
access
to
spectrum
for
Indigenous
communities.
5.
Collaborative
backhaul
solutions
founded
on
future-proof
technology.
6.
Research
on
the
state
of
Indigenous
connectivity
across
North
America.
(p.
2)
These
recommendations
aim
to
"promote
sustainable
connectivity"
(Campbell,
2018,
p.
2).
Integrating
these
recommendations
advances
Indigenous
self-determination
and
autonomy
while
6
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data

connecting
Indigenous
Peoples
to
the
Internet
“on
their
own
terms”
(Campbell,
2018,
p.
4).
Other
Indigenous
institutions
and
coalitions
have
also
formed
to
respond
to
the
lack
of
Internet
connectivity
for
Indigenous
Peoples
across
national
jurisdictions.
The
National
Congress
of
American
Indians
(NCAI)
advocated
that
the
United
States
Federal
Communications
Commission
(FCC)
increase
and
improve
its
broadband
data
deployment
to
ensure
that
Tribal
Nations
have
access
to
an
equitable
digital
future.
For
example,
the
Pamunkey
Tribal
Headquarters
(Virginia)
does
not
have
access
to
broadband,
meanwhile
the
Makah
Tribe
(Washington)
must
bus
students
40+
minutes
to
take
standardized
testing
(Blackwater ,
2021).
With
that
said,
in
2022
the
Biden-Harris
Administration
launched
a
$45
Billion
“Internet
for
All”
Initiative
(U.S.
Department
of
Commerce,
2022).
The
aim
of
this
initiative
is
to
bring
affordable
and
reliable
broadband
high-speed
Internet
to
everyone
within
the
United
States.
It
is
vital
that
this
Initiative
includes
addressing
affordability
and
access
issues
in
unincorporated
territories
where
Indigenous
Peoples
in
Puerto
Rico,
Guam,
American
Samoa
and
other
island
territories
also
face
rampant
digital
colonialism.
In
addition
to
the
“Internet
for
All”
program,
the
Affordable
Connectivity
Program
(ACP)
aims
to
increase
the
affordability
of
the
Internet
(The
White
House,
2023).
However ,
barriers
continue
to
exist
as
program
applicants
must
have
access
to
the
Internet
to
complete
the
online
application
(FCC,
2023).
As
illustrated,
many
Indigenous
Peoples
do
not
have
equal
access
to
the
Internet.
Unfortunately ,
this
is
also
true
for
many
Māori
and
Pacifica
households
in
Aotearoa/New
Zealand
who
lack
Internet
connectivity
(Carr ,
2020).
This
disadvantage
has
a
significant
impact
on
their
ability
to
participate
fully
in
the
digital
age.
They
often
struggle
to
access
important
information,
connect
with
others,
and
access
vital
services.
The
COVID-19
pandemic
exacerbated
many
of
these
pre-existing
Internet
connectivity
injustices
for
Indigenous
Peoples,
further
ing
divides
in
access
to
education,
healthcare,
and
economic
opportunities
(Carr ,
2020).
Similarly ,
in
Canada,
Lockhart
et
al.
(2014)
noted
that
even
where
a
First
Nation
has
access
to
high-speed
Internet
connectivity
in
educational
and
administrative
buildings,
that
connectivity
often
does
not
extend
to
all
households
on
reserve,
interfering
with
Indigenous
Peoples’
ability
to
continue
studies
and
work
from
home.
This
is
not
an
isolated
incident
as
many
First
Nations
reserves
across
Canada
experience
severe
Internet
connectivity
issues.
According
to
recent
data,
only
34.8
percent
of
First
Nations
People
residing
in
these
areas
have
access
to
a
50/10
Mb/s
connection
(Ahmmed
et
al.,
2022).
This
la
ck
of
reliable
Internet
access
can
have
significant
impacts
on
education,
healthcare,
and
economic
opportunities
for
these
communities.
It
is
essential
that
governments
work
towards
providing
equal
access
to
Internet
services
for
all
Indigenous
Peoples,
regardless
of
where
they
reside.
Solutions
to
address
connectivity
include
the
deployment
of
satellite-based
systems
rather
than
fiber
optics.
However ,
the
existing
mechanisms
for
accessing
wireless
spectrum
licenses
do
not
provide
equitable
pathways
for
Indigenous
ownership
and
control.
Connecting
Indigenous
communities
to
high-speed
bro
adband
Internet
is
imperative
for
promoting
reconciliation,
including
economic
reconciliation,
and
realizing
Indigenous
self-determination
(Ahmmed
et
al.,
2022;
Hobart
and
Woodhouse,
2022).

Internet
connectivity
enables
these
communities
to
preserve
their
culture,
language,
and
heritage
while
also
promoting
economic
development
and
education.
The
availability
of
dedicated
wireless
spectrum
over
Indigenous
territories
plays
an
important
role
in
achieving
this
goal.
It
is
vital
for
governments
and
the
GDC
to
acknowledge
the
significance
of
this
issue
and
take
the
necessary
steps
to
ensure
that
Indigenous
communities
have
access
to
dedicated
spectrum.
However ,
we
cannot
stop
at
affordability
and
accessibility .
It
is
not
only
important
to
create
and
implement
equitable
digital
infrastructure
and
policies,
but
it
is
also
necessary
to
understand
the
cultural
significance
and
utilization
of
the
data.
For
example,
historically ,
Indigenous
biomedical
data
has
been
exploited
for
scientific
research
(Carroll
et
al.,
2022).
Oftentimes,
data
collection
practices
overlook
community
rights,
benefits
and
interests,
ultimately
justifying
Indigenous
Peoples’
reluctance
to
share
health
data
(Carroll
et
al.,
2022;
Claw
et
al.,
2018).
Even
when
the
original
data
collection
of
this
genetic
material
is
collected
under
rigorous
ethical
protocols,
the
strict
mechanisms
practiced
during
collection
are
omitted
when
data
are
uploaded
to
broad-scale
databases,
resulting
in
the
commodification
of
Indigenous
Peoples’
DNA
and
other
health
data
(Carroll
et
al.,
2022;
Fox,
2020).
Thus,
policies
must
be
implemented
to
ensure
that
agreements
made
during
data
collection
cannot
be
broken
during
data
sharing.
Technological
developments
continue
to
advance
at
an
accelerated
rate,
transforming
every
sector
across
the
globe.
From
healthcare
to
entertainment,
education
to
employment,
acquiring
digital
skills
is
becoming
increasingly
necessary
to
meet
and
harmonize
with
the
ever-moving
pace
of
today’ s
society .
However ,
globally
there
is
a
significant
percentage
of
the
population
who
lack
access
and
opportunity
to
technology
and
the
Internet
of
Things
(IoT)
(Ang,
2020).
For
example,
in
the
United
States,
approximately
24
million
people,
or
1
in
5
households,
lack
access
to
high-speed
Internet
(NTIA,
2023).
This
digital
divide
is
not
unique
to
the
U.S.,
with
many
other
countries
experiencing
similar
disparities.
Moreover ,
the
lack
of
access
to
the
Internet
disproportionately
affects
marginalized
communities,
including
Indigenous
Peoples,
people
with
disabilities,
low-income
households,
and
rural
communities.
From
cost
and
affordability
to
accessibility ,
universal
Internet
access
must
become
a
basic
human
right
(UN,
2021c).
Several
strategies
can
increase
Internet
connectivity
in
Indigenous
communities,
especially
in
remote
areas.
A
necessary
approach
is
to
develop
policies
and
initiatives
that
target
Internet
connectivity
in
these
remote
areas,
such
as
investing
in
infrastructure
development.
This
can
be
achieved
by
building
more
cell
towers,
fiber
optic
networks,
and
deploying
satellite-based
systems.
To
accomplish
this
there
is
also
the
need
for
economic
support
programs
to
provide
pathways
for
Indigenous
Nations
and
communities
to
access
the
necessary
capital
to
develop
and
own
these
infrastructures
without
incurring
exponential
d
ebt
(Couture
and
Toupin,
2019;
Duarte,
2017;
Kwet,
2022).
O
verall,
these
approaches
can
help
to
improve
access
to
the
Internet
in
Indigenous
territories
and
remote
communities.

Protecting
the
rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples
to
access
education
is
essential
for
promoting
equitable
opportunities
for
all
individuals.
This
is
particularly
important
when
it
comes
to
digital
education,
given
the
increasing
importance
of
technology
in
our
global
society .
Indigenous
communities
must
be
able
to
access
digital
education
and
STEM
education
to
remain
competitive
and
to
ensure
their
voices
are
heard
in
the
digital
age.
UNDRIP
Article
14:
Right
to
Education
represents
the
rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples,
especially
youth,
to
“establish
and
control
their
educational
systems
and
institutions
providing
education
in
their
own
languages,
in
a
manner
appropriate
to
their
cultural
methods
of
teaching
and
learning”
(UN,
2007).
Moreover ,
this
Article
states
that,
Indigenous
individuals,
particularly
children,
have
the
right
to
all
levels
and
forms
of
education
of
the
state
without
discrimination.
States
shall,
in
conjunction
with
Indigenous
Peoples,
take
effective
measures,
in
order
for
Indigenous
individuals,
particularly
children,
including
those
living
outside
their
communities,
to
have
access,
when
possible,
to
an
education
in
their
own
culture
and
provided
in
their
own
language.
(UN,
2007)
This
includes
access
to
digital
education
and
STEM
education,
as
well
as
the
resources
and
support
needed
to
succeed
in
these
fields.
Furthermore,
ensuring
Indigenous
rights
to
digital
education
and
STEM
education
is
essential
for
promoting
diversity
and
inclusion
in
the
technology
industry .
For
example,
IndigiData
is
an
Indigenous
digital
education
program
that
offers
a
one-week
workshop
to
under graduate
and
graduate
students.
The
workshop
provides
an
Indigenous-centered
curriculum
and
is
led
by
a
community
of
Indigenous
data
scientists
and
guest
faculty .
The
program
focuses
on
data
sovereignty
and
ethics,
as
well
as
providing
hands-on
experience
and
training
in
data
science
and
informatics.
By
incorporating
Indigenous
culture
into
the
curriculum,
IndigiData
aims
to
inspire
the
next
generation
of
innovators
and
strengthen
Indigenous
communit
ies
(IndigiData.
2023).
Through
inclusive
and
culturally
sensitive
programs
like
IndigiData,
the
valuable
contributions
of
Indigenous
Peoples
can
be
recognized
and
utilized,
not
only
in
the
field
of
data
science
but
also
in
broader
societal
advancements.
Indigenous
Peoples
bring
unique
perspectives
and
experiences
to
the
table,
which
can
help
drive
innovation
and
foster
greater
collaboration
across
cultural
and
national
boundaries.
Moreover ,
as
the
frequency
of
pandemics
increases,
the
likelihood
of
work
experience
and
education
transitioning
to
online
platforms
will
rise
(
Ahmmed
et
al.,
2022;
Robinso
n,
2022).
Access
to
the
Internet
can
be
revolutionary
as
it
increases
an
indiv
idual’ s
opportunity
for
education,
business,
healthcare,
and
more
(Greenfield,
2020).
Thus,
another
critical
strategy
is
to
increase
funding
and
resources
for
Indigenous
schools
and
educational
institutions
in
Indigenous
communities.
Schools
play
an
essential
role
in
providing
access
to
education,
and
by
supplying
resources
such
as
computers
and
high-speed
Internet,
Indigenous
students
can
receive
a
quality
education
and
develop
the
skills
they
need
to
succeed
in
the
digital
age.
9
CARE
Statement

Protecting
the
rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples
to
digital
education
is
also
important
from
a
cultural
perspective.
Indigenous
languages
and
cultures
are
unique
and
must
be
preserved
for
future
generations.
By
ensuring
that
Indigenous
communities
have
access
to
digital
education,
they
can
develop
and
share
resources
that
help
preserve
their
cultural
heritage,
including
language,
traditional
knowledge,
and
cultural
practice
s
(Campbell,
2018).
T o
realize
its
commitments
to
connect
all
people
to
the
Internet,
including
all
schools,
the
Global
Digital
Compact
should:
●
Invest
in
infrastructure
development
to
improve
access
to
Internet
connectivity
in
Indigenous
communities.
●
Ensure
affordability
and
accessibility
of
high-speed
Internet,
including
addressing
affordability
and
access
issues
in
areas
where
Indigenous
Peoples
face
digital
colonialism.
●
Increase
funding
and
resources
for
schools
and
educational
institutions
in
Indigenous
communities
to
provide
resources
such
as
computers
and
high-speed
Internet,
enabling
Indigenous
students
to
receive
a
quality

●
Ensure
Indigenous
rights
to
digital

and
STEM

including
access
to

and
supports
needed
to
succeed
in
these
fields.
2.
A void
Internet
fragmentation
The
issue
of
Internet
fragmentation
is
a
growing
concern
in
the
digital
age,
as
it
can
lead
to
the
creation
of
separate
and
distinct
online
communities,
which
may
not
be
able
to
communicate
or
collaborate
effectively
with
each
other .
A
fragmented
Internet
means
that
a
system
is
not
fully
interoperable,
and
research
suggests
that
the
likelihood
of
the
Internet
splintering
into
“islands
of
connectivity”
is
increasing
(Drake
et
al.,
2016).
This
can
create
significant
challenges
for
Indigenous
individuals,
businesses,
and
governments
alike,
and
it
is
important
that
steps
are
taken
to
avoid
this
fragmentation.
For
Indigenous
Peoples,
Internet
fragmentation
can
further
marginalize
their
communities
and
limit
their
ability
to
connect
with
other
groups
and
access
critical
resources
and
information
(Jonas
and
Burrell,
2019).
Settler -colonial
state
hegemonic
attempts
to
control
Indigenous
Peoples’
use
of
the
Internet
must
not
be
tolerated.
The
Global
Digital
Compact
can
promote
Indigenous
sovereignty
and
champion
Indigenous
Peoples’
rights
to
free
Internet
use
unrestricted
by
settler -colonial
censorship.
To
maintain
a
cohesive
and
connected
digital
environment,
fragmentation
in
the
digital
ecosystem,
which
can
significantly
affect
the
way
Indigenous
Peoples
use
and
access
the
Internet,
must
be
addressed.
This
requires
addressing
the
three
main
types
of
fragmentation:
1.
Technical
fragmentation
driven
by
technological
developments,
2.
Governmental
fragmentation
driven
by
government
policies,
and
3.
Commercial
fragmentation
driven
by
commercial
practices
(Drake
et
al.,
2016).
The
issue
of
online
violence
has
increasingly
become
a
significant
10
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
challenge
in
the
digital
ecosystem
that
can
be
exacerbated
by
internet
fragmentation.
Women
and
youth
are
especially
vulnerable
to
online
violence,
which
can
take
the
form
of
cyberstalking,
harassment,
bullying,
and
other
forms
of
abusive
behavior .
This
phenomenon
has
emer ged
as
a
result
of
the
growth
of
social
media
and
other
online
platforms
that
have
enabled
greater
connectivity
but
also
facilitated
the
spread
of
harmful
content.
The
fragmentation
of
the
Internet
exacerbates
this
problem
as
it
creates
separate
and
distinct
online
communities
that
can
foster
harmful
and
abusive
behavior .
This
is
a
major
concern
for
Indigenous
Peoples,
who
are
extremely
vulnerable
to
these
forms
of
harassment
and
abuse
(Carlson
and
Frazer ,
2021;
Cassels,
2019).
Therefore,
stopping
online
violence,
especially
for
women
and
youth,
requires
not
only
tackling
its
root
causes
but
also
limiting
Internet
fragmentation
by
promoting
a
more
cohesive
and
connected
digital
ecosystem
(Simon,
2023).
If
adopted,
these
protocols
will
not
only
protect
th
e
rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples
in
digital
spaces
but
also
ensure
their
voices
are
heard
and
respected
online.
Another
important
consideration
is
the
need
for
greater
Indigenous
representation
in
digital
technology
fields
and
governance
(Bang
et
al.,
2013).
Indigenous
Peoples
have
a
unique
perspective
on
technology
and
the
Internet,
and
their
knowledge
and
expertise
should
be
valued
and
incorporated
into
the
development
and
governance
of
digital
systems.
For
example,
students
from
Kaktovik,
Alaska
invented
“
Kaktovik
Numerals”,
an
unparalleled
decimal
system
inspired
by
Iñupiaq,
the
Alaskan
Inuit
language
using
“an
oral
counting
system
built
around
the
human
body”
(
Tillinghast-Raby
,
2023,
Figure
#2).
As
of
2022,
the
UC
Berkeley
Department
of
Linguistics’ s
Script
Encoding
Initiative
included
the
Kaktovik
Numerals
in
Unicode.
Unicode
15.0
“provides
a
virtual
identifier
for
each
Kaktovik
numeral
so
developers
can
incorporate
them
into
digital
displays”
(
Tillinghast-Raby
,
2023).
This
example
is
one
of
many
that
illustrates
Indigenous
Peoples’
contributions
to
technology
when
given
access
to
resources
and
institutional
support.

CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
In
addition,
the
GDC
must
advocate
protecting
the
use
of
Indigenous
names
and
languages
online
from
digital
harassment
and
structural
oppression.
In
2015,
Indigenous
Facebook
users
reported
having
their
accounts
flagged
and
access
to
the
social
media
platform
revoked
because
their
Indigenous
names
were
flagged
as
“n
ot
real”
(Bowman,
2015;
Haimson
and
Hoffmann,
2016).
R
egrettably ,
such
instances
are
prevalent
not
only
on
social
media
but
also
on
digital
platforms
that
do
not
accommodate
the
naming
conventions
and
alphabets
(e.g.
pictorial,
syllabic,
etc.)
unique
to
Indigenous
Peoples.
For
example,
Indigenous
families
often
have
to
fight
to
have
their
child’ s
name
reflected
accurately
on
their
records
of
vital
statistics,
including
birth
certificates
and
other
forms
of
identifica
tion
(McKenzie,
2023).
As
a
consequence,
Indigenous
Peoples
are
being
excluded
from
digital
platforms,
further
fragmenting
the
Internet.
Mitigating
this
issue
requires
a
multifaceted
approach,
which
includes
disrupting
the
“colonial
algorithm”
with
the
formulation
of
new
policies
and
guidelines,
as
well
as
promoting
Indigenous
scholars
and
digital
activists
into
decision-making
positions
of
p
ower
(Fredericks
et
al.,
2022).
In
addition
to
protecting
Indigenous
names
and
languages
from
exclusion
on
the
Internet,
it
is
also
essential
to
carve
out
protected
space
and
policies
for
Indigenous
digital
heritage.
One
research
initiative
working
towards
this
goal
is
Local
Context,
which
collaborates
with
Indigenous
communities
and
organizations
such
as
cultural
centers,
universities,
and
museums
to
manage,
share,
and
protect
Indigenous
intellectual
property ,
data
and
digital
heritage
by
creating
Traditional
Knowledge
(TK)
and
Biocultural
Labels
(BC)
(Local
Context,
2023).
These
labels
“add
cultural
and
historical
context”
as
well
as
“cultural
authority
to
cultural
heritage
content”
in
the
Indigenous
communities’
digital
heritage
archive,
in
addition
to
“libraries,
museums
and
other
digital
repositories”
across
the
globe
(Local
Context,
2023).
Such
labels
are
crucial
for
IDSov
and
preventing
Internet
fragmentation
of
Indigenous
Peoples
as
they
help
to
ensure
that
Indigenous
knowledge
and
cultural
heritage
are
accurately
represented
and
contextualized
within
the
larger
digital
ecosystem.
By
adding
cultural
and
historical
context,
these
labels
acknowledge
the
legal
jurisdiction
and
cultural
authority
of
Indigenous
communities
over
their
own
heritage
content
and
help
to
prevent
misrepresentation
or
appropriation
of
Indigenous
knowledge
and
cultural
practices.
To
this
end,
it
is
necessary
for
academic
and
global
Internet
institutions
to
play
a
key
role
in
providing
support
and
resources
for
the
advancement
of
Indigenous
digital
scholars
and
practitioners.
As
digital
technologies
continue
to
develop
and
expand,
Indigenous
communities
are
increasingly
at
risk
of
being
excluded
from
the
digital
sphere,
perpetuating
the
effects
of
historical
colonization.
To
address
this
issue,
institutions
must
take
the
initiative
to
provide
funding,
resources,
and
mentorship
opportunities
to
Indigenous
scholars
working
in
digital
fields
(Local
Context,
2023;
Small-Rodriguez,
2023).
These
actions
will
not
only
support
the
preservation
and
promotion
of
Indigenous
knowledge
and
cultural
heritage
but
also
contribute
to
building
a
more
connected
and
inclusive
digital
world.
By
collaborating
with
Indigenous
scholars
and
communities,
global
institutions
can
help
to
avoid
Internet
fragmentation
and
promote
greater
equity
and
representation
in
the
digital
realm.

Pr otect
Data
As
we
work
towards
creating
a
more
connected
and
inclusive
digital
world,
it
is
imperative
that
we
center
the
principles
of
IDSov
and
recognize
the
unique
needs
and
perspectives
of
Indigenous
communities.
To
this
end,
we
advocate
for
the
GDC
to
make
commitments
to
protecting
data
through
an
IDSov
approach.
IDSov
is
Indigenous
Peoples,
communities,
and
Nations’
inherent
right
to
govern,
steward,
and
control
their
own
data
(Walter
et
al.,
2021).
Among
acknowledging
and
emphasizing
the
importance
of
data
for
advancing
governance,
innovation
and
Indigenous
self-determination,
the
CARE
Principles
for
Indigenous
Data
Governance
address
the
data
inequities
and
exploitation
of
Indigenous
data
(Carroll
et
al.,
2020).
Indigenous
data
refers
to
data
that
is
collected,
produced,
or
used
by
Indigenous
Peoples
or
communities,
often
in
the
context
of
research,
policy
development,
or
service
delivery .
It
includes
a
wide
range
of
information
related
to
Indigenous
knowledge,
culture,
language,
land,
and
socio-economic
conditions.
Indigenous
data
is
distinct
from
other
forms
of
data
because
it
reflects
Indigenous
perspectives,
values,
and
priorities,
and
is
often
subject
to
unique
ethical,
legal,
and
cultural
considerations.
However ,
Indigenous
data
has
repeatedly
been
abused.
In
the
late
1990s,
the
Havasupai
Tribe
of
Arizona
granted
access
to
their
blood
samples
to
researchers
at
Arizona
State
University
for
the
purpose
of
studying
the
genetic
basis
of
diabetes
in
their
community
(
Lovett
et
al.,
2019
).
However ,
without
the
Tribe's
knowledge
or
consent,
the
samples
were
used
for
additional
health
research
unrelated
to
the
original
purpose.
The
Havasupai
People
felt
that
their
trust
had
been
violated
and
sued
the
University
for
breach
of
contract,
leading
to
a
legal
settlement
and
the
return
of
the
blood
samples
in
2004
(Lovett
et
al.,
2019)
.
The
case
highlights
the
importance
of
respecting
IDSov
and
the
need
for
ethical
and
responsible
research
practices
to
protect
Indigenous
data
(Lovett
et
al.,
2019).
Established
in
2018,
the
Native
BioData
Consortium
(NBDC)
created
a
goal
to
“leverage
Indigenous
sovereignty
and
keep
biological
samples
and
data
from
tribal
members
local
to
their
13
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
community”
(NBDC,
2021).
This
internationally
renowned
Consortium
is
recognized
for
its
achievements
in
Indigenous
health
equity
through
tribal
research
and
policy
(NBDC,
2021).
This
Consortium
aligns
with
IDSov
objectives,
including
Indigenous
self-determination
and
autonomy
over
data
(inclusive
of
knowledge
and
information
systems),
institutions,
and
resources
(Walter
et
al.,
2021).
Similarly ,
IDGov
is
the
inherent
sovereign
right
of
autonomy
over
Indigenous
data
(Carroll
et
al.,
2019).
IDSov
and
IDGov
provide
the
framework
for
the
protection
of
Ind
igenous
data.
According
to
Indigenous
data
scientists
Carroll
et
al.
(2020),
Indigenous
Peoples’
data
includes:
(1)
Information
and
knowledge
about
the
environment,
lands,
skies,
resources,
and
non-humans
with
which
they
have
relations;
(2)
Information
about
Indigenous
persons
such
as
administrative,
census,
health,
social,
commercial,
and
corporate
and,
(3)
Information
and
knowledge
about
Indigenous
Peoples
as
collectives,
including
traditional
and
cultural
information,
oral
histories,
ancestral
and
clan
knowledge,
cultural
sites,
and
stories,
belongings.

The
CARE
Principles
for
Indigenous
Data
Governance
provide
the
mechanism
to
operationalize
the
ethical
governance
of
Indigenous
Data.
The
acronym
"CARE"
stands
for
Collective
Benefit,
Authority
to
Control,
Responsibility ,
and
Ethic
s
(Carroll
et
al.,
2020).
These
principles
prioritize
Indigenous
self-determination
and
the
protection
of
Indigenous
knowledge,
cultures,
and
intellectual
property
rights.
They
provide
a
framework
for
Indigenous
communities
and
organizations
to
manage
and
govern
their
data
in
a
way
that
aligns
with
their
cultural
values
and
ensures
the
responsible
use
of
their
data
and
the
opportunity
to
maintain
good
data
relations.
The
concept
of
“relations”
or
relationality
is
central
to
Indigenous
worldviews
and
ways
of
knowing.
In
the
context
of
the
previous
quote
from
Carroll
et
al.
(2020),
relations
can
be
understood
as
the
connections
and
interrelationships
that
Indigenous
Peoples
have
with
various
aspects
of
Indigenous
data,
including
their
environment,
the
non-human
world,
other
people,
and
cultural
traditions.
Indigenous
Peoples’
knowledge
systems
include
the
environment,
such
as
land,
skies,
resources,
and
non-human
beings,
which
they
are
connected
and
interdependent
on
through
traditional
ecological
knowledge
and
practices.
The
interconnection
and
relationality
are
central
to
data
stewardship
across
the
data
ecosystem
and
are
informed
by
shared
values,
principles
and
protocols
for
ensuring
relational
accountability
within
Indigenous
Peoples’
Nations,
villages,
and
communities
(Durie,
2004;
Kovach,
2021).
Additionally ,
understanding
the
relationships
between
Indigenous
individuals,
their
communities,
and
the
larger
systems
they
operate
within,
such
as
census
data,
health
records,
and
social
and
commercial
interactions,
is
essential
for
addressing
issues
of
equity
and
justice
and
promoting
relational
accountability
(Oré
et
al.,
2023).
Finally ,
relations
and
relationality
also
encompass
how
knowledge
and
information
are
held
and
transmitted
through
generations
and
intergenerational
agency
is
pivotal
to
Indigenous
data
sovereignty
(IDSov)
and
governance
(IDG
ov)
(Littletree
et
al.,
2020).

CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
Therefore,
protecting
data
is
an
important
aspect
of
responsible
and
ethical
research,
particularly
when
working
with
Indigenous
communities
(Animikii
Inc.,
2022).
The
integration
and
utilization
of
tribal
research
codes
can
help
ensure
that
research
conducted
with
Indigenous
communities
is
respectful,
culturally
appropriate,
and
prioritizes
the
well-being
and
interests
of
the
community .
Utilizing
tribal
research
codes
will
allow
organizations
and
communities
to
implement
the
CARE
Principles
to
coincide
and
enhance
the
FAIR
Guiding
Principles
(Carroll
et
al.,
2022).
The
FAIR
Guiding
Principles
provide
a
framework
for
making
data
more
accessible
and
reusable,
but
they
do
not
explicitly
address
issues
of
cultural
sensitivity
and
Indigenous
ownership.
Research
codes
and
institutional
review
board
processes
that
embed
the
CARE
Principles
in
conjunction
with
the
FAIR
Guiding
Principles,
allow
for
Indigenous
Peoples
and
communities
to
have
greater
control
over
their
data
and
ensure
that
their
rights
are
respected.
This
is
in
line
with
the
National
Congress
of
American
Indians
(NCAI)
resolution,
which
calls
for
tribal
control
over
data
and
biospecimens,
highlighting
the
importance
of
Indigenous
ownership
and
governance
of
data.
The
NCAI
passed
Resolution
ABQ-19-061,
which
“calls
on
NIH
[National
Institutes
of
Health]
to
consult
with
Tribal
Nations,
provide
a
process
for
Tribal
Nations
to
have
oversight
over
any
data
and
biospecimens
from
their
tribal
citizens,
and
restrict
use
of
data
associated
with
Tribal
Nations
until
tribal
oversight
is
in
place”
(NCAI,
2019).
This
resolution
recognizes
that
Indigenous
Nations
are
sovereign
governments
and
that
data
associated
with
Tribal
Nations
should
not
be
used
without
tribal
consent.
This
is
particularly
important
given
the
historical
and
continuing
exploitation
of
Indigenous
Peoples
in
research,
thus
it
is
essential
to
prioritize
Indigenous-led
research
and
foster
increased
collaboration
and
partnership
between
researchers
and
Indigenous
communities.
Overall,
protecting
data
is
not
only
necessary
for
responsible
and
ethical
research
but
also
for
ensuring
Indigenous
self-determination
and
sovereignty .
Beyond
research
concerns,
protecting
data
privacy
and
security
is
of
critical
importance
for
Indigenous
Nations
and
Peoples.
With
the
technological
advancements
in
recent
years,
there
has
been
a
growing
recognition
of
the
need
to
protect
personal
data,
particularly
in
the
health
and
genomic
fields.
Though
Macaulay
et
al.
(1998)
noted
that
the
Code
of
Research
Ethics,
co-developed
with
Kahnawake
School
Diabetes
Prevention
Project,
defined
“community
ownership”,
Mohammed
et
al.
(2012)
found
cause
for
concern
due
to
nuances
and
varying
interpretations
of
the
term
“ownership”.
Moreover ,
in
2019,
Woodbury
et
al.
found
that
the
management
of
health-related
data
involving
Indigenous
Peoples
still
needed
improvement.
This
includes
data
within
policies,
protocols,
and
practices
(Woodbury
et
al.,
2019).
In
addition
to
addressing
research
conduct
concerns,
it
is
essential
that
policies
and
language
in
research
agreements
are
drafted
in
a
manner
that
is
unambiguous
and
protects
the
privacy
and
security
of
data
for
Indigenous
Nations
and
Peoples.
Thus,
it
is
vital
that
the
GDC,
in
collaboration
with
Indigenous
communities,
explicitly
define
best
practices
for
protecting
Indigenous
data
privacy
and
security
with
a
foundation
built
on
IDSov
and
IDGov
principles.
15
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
While
there
have
been
some
positive
developments
in
data
privacy
legislation,
there
is
still
a
long
way
to
go.
Indigenous
Nations
and
Peoples
face
unique
challenges
when
it
comes
to
protecting
their
data,
including
accountability ,
privacy ,
and
confidentiality
on
both
an
individual
and
collective
level.
It
is
important
to
scale
data
protections
for
Indigenous
Nations
and
Peoples,
including
developing
frameworks
and
regulations
that
address
the
specific
needs
of
these
communities.
However ,
it
is
also
essential
to
ensure
that
these
frameworks
are
implemented
effectively
and
that
Indigenous
communities
have
the
resources
and
support
they
need
to
protect
their
data.
This
requires
a
coordinated
effort
from
governments,
technology
companies,
and
community-based
organizations,
including
investments
in
infrastructure,
education,
and
training.
This
effort
should
include
the
adoption
of
the
CARE
Principles
in
conjunction
with
the
FAIR
Guiding
Principles,
TRUST
Principles
and
First
Nations
principles
of
OCAP
(Ownership,
Control,
Access,
and
Possession)
into
data
governance
regimes
(Carroll
et
al.,
2020).
The
CARE
Principles
enhance
the
FAIR
Guiding
Principles
and
TRUST
Principles
by
grounding
its
core
in
equity
(Carroll
et
al.,
2022).
This
method
of
governance
shifts
settler
colonial
consultation
practices
to
instead
focus
on
value-based
relationships
that
prioritize
Indigenous
knowledge
systems,
culture,
and
science
(Carroll
et
al.,
2020).
Adoption
of
the
CARE
principles
by
the
GDC
will
promote
the
protection
of
Indigenous
data
privacy
and
security ,
and
ensure
Indigenous
rights
to
self-determination
and
control
over
their
data
are
respected.
T o
realize
its
commitments
to
protect
data,
the
Global
Digital
Compact
should:
●
Acknowledge
and
emphasize
the
importance
of
UNDRIP
and
Indigenous
data
for
advancing
governance,
innovation,
and
Indigenous
self-determination.
●
Encourage
governments
at
national,
regional,
and
global
levels
to
implement
the
CARE
Principles
for
Indigenous
Data
Governance
to
address
the
data
inequities
and
exploitation
of
Indigenous
data.
●
Promote
the
integration
of
Indigenous
research
codes
and
the
implementation
of
CARE
Principles
and
FAIR
Guiding
Principles
to
protect
Indigenous
communities'
data,
recognize
Indigenous
data
sovereignty ,
and
prevent
exploitation
in
research.
●
Establish
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
as
Indigenous
Peoples,
communities,
and
Nations
inherent
right
to
govern,
steward,
and
control
their
own
data.
●
Protect
data
privacy
and
security
by
developing
frameworks
and
regulations
that
address
the
specific
needs
of
Indigenous
communities.

Apply
Human
Rights
Online
In
the
digital
age,
the
need
for
upholding
human
rights
has
extended
online.
However ,
it
is
crucial
to
recognize
that
Indigenous
rights
must
also
be
applied
online,
with
a
particular
focus
on
bridging
the
digital
divide
and
gaps
impacting
Indigenous
Peoples,
promoting
digital
inclusion
for
Indigenous
Peoples,
and
supporting
the
United
Nations
Declaration
on
the
Rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples
(UNDRIP).
To
ensure
that
digital
inclusion
metrics
align
with
UNDRIP ,
an
IDSov/CARE
lens
must
be
applied
to
all
interventions
around
digital
cooperation
and
technologies.
Moreover ,
it
is
necessary
to
pay
special
attention
to
the
situation
of
Indigenous
Peoples
impacted
by
digital
colonialism
and
place
UNDRIP
at
the
center
of
regulatory
frameworks
and
legislation
on
digital
technologies.
Therefore,
it
is
essential
to
explore
how
the
Global
Digital
Compact
can
apply
human
rights
online
to
promote
the
protection
and
respect
of
Indigenous
rights.
The
Global
Indigenous
Data
Alliance
(GIDA)
has
created
a
list
of
rights
to
demonstrate
Indigenous
Peoples’
Rights
in
Data,
specifically
(Figure
3):
Figure

(GIDA,

17

CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
The
purposes
of
these
rights
are
to
advocate
for
data
management
that
abides
by
international
laws
and
regulations
and
to
progress
and
foster
IDSov
that
furthers
legislation
and
data
protections
(GIDA,
2022a;
GIDA,
2023).
It
is
important
to
note
that
digital
inclusion
metrics
must
align
with
UNDRIP .
For
example,
Article
4
states,
“Indigenous
Peoples,
in
exercising
their
right
to
self-determination,
have
the
right
to
autonomy
or
self-government
in
matters
relating
to
their
internal
and
local
affairs,
as
well
as
ways
and
means
for
financing
their
autonomous
functions”
(UN,
2007).
While
OCAP
“asserts
that
First
Nations
have
control
over
data
collection,
processes,
and
that
they
own
and
control
how
this
information
can
be
used”
(FNIGC,
2023).
To
ensure
equitable
digital
cooperation
and
technological
development,
it
is
important
to
consider
and
integrate
existing
Indigenous
protocols
and
principles
into
the
digital
inclusion
metrics.
In
other
words,
embodying
these
metrics
based
on
collaborative
efforts
co-developed
with
Indigenous
Peoples
can
provide
a
solid
foundation
for
achieving
this
goal.
Moreover ,
global
society
must
recognize
that
Indigenous
Peoples
have
existing
research
codes,
data
management
protocols,
and
ethical
guidelines
to
protect
their
rights
and
interests
in
digital
spaces
and
for
data.
Therefore,
policies
and
agreements
related
to
digital
technologies
should
refer
to
these
documents
to
ensure
that
they
are
drafted
in
a
manner
that
respects
Indigenous
Peoples'
rights
and
sovereignty .
By
leveraging
existing
collaborative
data
frameworks,
such
as
the
CARE
Principles,
developed
by
and
with
Indigenous
Peoples,
this
approach
avoids
redundancy
and
facilitates
more
effective,
collaborative,
and
respectful
relationships
between
technology
stakeholders
and
Indigenous
communities.
This
is
particularly
important
as
access
to
high-speed
Internet
becomes
increasingly
necessary
for
remote
Indigenous
communities,
who
face
amplified
inequalities
during
global
pandemics
and
environmental
catastrophes
due
to
their
lack
of
online
services.
As
climate
change
inevitably
alters
the
planet
and
peoples’
livelihoods,
access
to
high-speed
Internet
is
crucial.
From
accessing
doctors
and
educational
services
to
registering
for
COVID-19
vaccinations,
bridging
the
digital
divide
is
vital
for
remote
Indigenous
communities
(Hobart
and
Woodhouse,
2022).
Global
pandemics
and
environmental
catastrophes
amplify
the
inequalities
that
Indigenous
communities
face
as
they
lack
access
to
online
services
(Carr ,
2020;
Carroll
et
al.,
2021a;
Hobart
and
Woodhouse,
2022).
As
we
strive
to
bridge
the
digital
divide
and
close
the
gaps
impacting
Indigenous
Peoples,
we
must
apply
a
human
rights
framework
to
our
efforts.
This
includes
supporting
UNDRIP
and
aligning
digital
inclusion
metrics
with
its
principles
(Kukutai
and
Taylor ,
2016).
This
means
placing
Indigenous
Peoples
at
the
center
of
decision-making
processes
and
ensuring
that
they
have
control
over
their
own
data.
Taiuru
et
al.
2022
provide
an
example
for
the
application
of
UNDRIP
in
digital
ecosystems
arguing
for
applying
UNDRIP
in
the
context
of
AgTech
and
agricultural
big
data
in
Aotearoa/New
Zealand.
They
explore
a
Māori
Data
Sovereignty
co-governance
approach
that
honors
Te
Tiriti,
He
Whakaputanga,
and/or
UNDRIP
and
how
the
adoption
of
such
principle
documents
disrupts
the
18
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
power
dynamics
that
perpetuate
the
inequitable
trajectories
of
big
data
in
agriculture.
For
instance,
a
co-governance
approach
could
enable
Māori
to
set
the
priorities
and
practices
for
collecting,
storing,
and
using
agricultural
big
data,
which
could
result
in
a
more
collaborative,
equitable,
and
just
process
(Taiuru
et
al.,
2022).
They
also
underscore
that
publicly
funded
projects
imbue
a
fiduciary
responsibility
on
settler
colonial
states,
especially
those
with
treaty
obligations,
to
ethically
create
data
infrastructures
that
support
Indigenous
Peoples’
access,
control,
ownership
and
decision-making
power
as
rights
and
titleholders
(Taiuru
et
al.,
2022).
UNDRIP
also
provides
protections
against
digital
colonialism,
which
often
results
in
the
exploitation
and
appropriation
of
Indigenous
data,
knowledge
and
resources
(Roberts
and
Montoya,
2022).
Mukosi
(2022)
highlights
the
connection
between
historical
colonialism,
assimilation
policies,
and
contemporary
digital
colonialism
in
the
context
of
adoption
records
for
Indigenous
adoptees
in
the
United
States.
The
article
positions
that
to
protect
Indigenous
rights
and
the
rights
of
Indigenous
children
data
policies
must
include
the
rights
delineated
in
the
UNDRIP ,
especially
data
policies
applicable
to
adoption
and
children
services
(Mukosi,
2022).
Therefore,
one
key
step
towards
protecting
Indigenous
rights
online
is
to
place
UNDRIP
at
the
center
of
regulatory
frameworks
and
legislation
on
digital
technologies.
This
means
recognizing
and
respecting
the
rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples
to
self-determination,
control
over
their
data,
and
protection
of
their
genealogical,
linguistic
and
cultural
heritage.
It
also
means
promoting
Indigenous
rights-based
domestic
laws
and
practices
for
the
protection
of
Indigenous
data
privacy .
These
protections
will
also
help
to
support
thriving
Indigenous
languages
in
digital
ecosystems.
The
United
Nations
has
recognized
the
importance
of
Indigenous
languages
by
designating
the
period
from
2022-2032
as
the
International
Decade
of
Indigenous
Languages
(IDIL2022-2032)
(UNESCO,
2022).
The
protection
and
revitalization
of
Indigenous
languages
are
also
recognized
in
the
United
Nations
Declaration
on
the
Rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples
(UNDRIP).
As
such,
any
efforts
to
promote
and
support
Indigenous
languages
online
must
align
with
the
principles
of
UNDRIP .
The
GDC
needs
to
be
inclusive
of
Indigenous
languages
in
order
to
support
IDIL
2022-2032.
The
inclusion
of
Indigenous
languages
in
the
GDC
can
help
address
the
issue
of
language
loss
and
promote
linguistic
diversity .
As
the
Permanent
Forum
on
Indigenous
Issues
highlighted,
most
endangered
languages
are
Indigenous,
and
this
puts
at
risk
the
cultures
and
knowledge
systems
they
represent
(UNESCO,
2022).
Including
Indigenous
languages
in
the
GDC
can
help
provide
access
to
Indigenous
Peoples
for
digital
tools,
platforms
and
content
in
these
languages.
Digital
libraries
can
be
created
by
Indigenous
Peoples
with
financial
and
legislative
support
from
governments
to
house
“cultural
objects,
stories,
songs
and
ceremonies”,
which
can
ensure
that
future
generations
will
have
access
to
Indigenous
languages
and
culture
in
perpetuity
(Campbell,
2018).
This
can
be
a
key
enabler
to
promote
and
protect
Indigenous
languages,
and
contribute
to
the
objectives
set
out
in
the
United
Nations
Declaration
on
the
19
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
Rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples.
The
GDC
can
therefore
play
an
important
role
in
supporting
the
IDIL
2022-2032
and
ensuring
the
preservation
and
promotion
of
Indigenous
languages.
At
the
heart
of
our
efforts
to
apply
human
rights
online
must
be
a
commitment
to
centering
Indigenous
voices
and
perspectives.
This
includes
engaging
with
Indigenous
communities
and
organizations
to
develop
policies
and
practices
that
are
aligned
with
their
needs
and
priorities.
It
also
means
creating
opportunities
for
Indigenous
Peoples
to
lead
in
digital
technology
fields
and
governance,
and
investing
in
their
capacity
to
do
so.
By
applying
a
human
rights
framework
to
our
efforts
to
bridge
the
digital
divide
and
promote
digital
inclusion
for
Indigenous
Peoples,
we
can
create
a
world
where
technology
is
used
to
promote
rather
than
undermine
Indigenous
rights.
This
requires
a
concerted
effort
from
governments,
technology
companies,
and
civil
society
organizations,
but
it
is
essential
if
we
are
to
create
a
future
that
is
just
and
equitable
for
all.
T o
realize
its
commitments
to
apply
human
rights
online,
the
Global
Digital
Compact
should:
●
Advocate
for
research
data
management
that
abides
by
international
laws
and
regulations
and
fosters
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
that
furthers
Indigenous
rights.
●
Ensure
digital
inclusion
metrics
align
with
UNDRIP
principles,
including
Indigenous
Peoples'
right
to
self-determination
and
autonomy
in
matters
relating
to
their
internal
and
national
affairs.
●
Apply
an
IDSov/CARE
lens
to
all
interventions
around
digital
cooperation
and
technologies.
●
Support
IDIL2022-2032
to
address
language
loss,
promote
linguistic
diversity ,
and
preserve
Indigenous
languages.
●
Place
UNDRIP
at
the
center
of
regulatory
frameworks
and
legislation
on
digital
technologies
to
protect
Indigenous
rights
in
digital
spaces.

Intr oduce
accountability
criteria
for
discrimination
and
misleading
content
Indigenous
communities
have
long
been
victims
of
systemic
discrimination
and
cultural
appropriation,
and
the
digital
world
is
no
exception
(Carlson
and
Frazer ,
2021).
In
recent
years,
there
has
been
an
increase
in
the
use
of
false
Indigenous
identities,
appropriation
of
Indigenous
cultures,
use
of
digital
redface,
and
the
spread
of
misleading
content
(Carlson
and
Kennedy ,
2021;
Fredericks
et
al.,
2022;
Miner ,
2021).
These
instances
have
led
to
harm
and
perpetuated
violence
against
Indigenous
Peoples,
particularly
Indigenous
women
and
girls
(Bailey
and
Shayan,
2021;
Carlson
and
Kennedy ,
2021).
There
is
an
urgent
need
for
accountability
mechanisms
to
address
these
issues
and
prevent
further
harm.
IDGov
experts
recommend
a
multifaceted
approach
that
includes
Indigenous-led
governance
and
decision-making
in
digital
technology
fields,
the
protection
of
Indigenous
names
and
languages
from
digital
harassment
and
20
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
structural
oppression,
and
the
regulation
of
online
platforms
that
perpetuate
discriminatory
and
harmful
content.
One
of
the
challenges
in
addressing
this
issue
is
the
lack
of
clear
and
consistent
definitions
of
what
constitutes
cultural
appropriation
and
misleading
content.
Indigenous
Peoples
should
be
involved
in
defining
these
terms
and
creating
guidelines
for
their
enforcement.
Online
platforms
should
also
be
held
accountable
for
the
content
they
host
and
the
impact
it
has
on
Indigenous
Peoples
and
communities.
Accountability
for
discrimination
and
misleading
content
is
a
critical
component
in
ensuring
that
Indigenous
women
are
safe
in
digital
spaces,
particularly
when
it
comes
to
gamification
and
online
video
game
platforms
(Miner ,
2022).
As
Indigenous
Data
Governance
Experts,
we
recognize
that
the
proliferation
of
digital
spaces
has
resulted
in
increased
instances
of
discrimination,
harassment,
and
objectification
of
Indigenous
women,
which
in
turn
has
contributed
to
the
ongoing
issue
of
Missing
and
Murdered
Indigenous
Women
(MMIW)
(Bailey
and
Shayan,
2021).
It
is
essential
that
platforms
and
developers
are
held
accountable
for
the
creation
and
distribution
of
content
that
promotes
violence
against
Indigenous
women,
including
the
use
of
rape
scenes
and
objectification
(Hoffin
and
Lee-T reweek,
2020).
This
type
of
content
perpetuates
harmful
stereotypes
and
reinforces
the
notion
that
Indigenous
women
are
disposable
and
unworthy
of
respect
and
dignity .
It
is
not
enough
for
platforms
to
simply
remove
this
type
of
content
after
it
has
been
brought
to
their
attention;
they
must
also
take
proactive
steps
to
prevent
its
creation
and
dissemination
in
the
first
place.
One
way
to
achieve
this
is
through
the
development
and
implementation
of
comprehensive
content
moderation
policies
that
specifically
address
discrimination,
harassment,
and
violence
against
Indigenous
women.
The
policy
development
should
be
co-developed
with
Indigenous
Peoples
and
Elders
(Campbell,
2018).
These
policies
should
include
clear
definitions
of
what
constitutes
harmful
content,
as
well
as
robust
reporting
and
enforcement
mechanisms
(Kennedy ,
2020).
In
addition,
platforms
must
be
transparent
about
their
content
moderation
practices,
including
the
number
of
reports
received,
the
actions
taken
in
response,
and
any
changes
made
to
policies
and
procedures.
Furthermore,
developers
and
platforms
should
work
in
partnership
with
Indigenous
communities
and
organizations
to
co-create
content
that
is
respectful
and
accurate
in
its
representation
of
Indigenous
cultures
and
experiences.
This
will
not
only
help
to
prevent
harmful
content
from
being
created
but
also
ensure
that
Indigenous
voices
are
included
in
the
development
of
digital
spaces
that
impact
their
communities.
Indigenous
game
developers
have
already
started
developing
protocols
for
their
industry
rooted
in
sovereignty
and
are
creating
game
spaces
that
reflect
their
diverse
Indigenous
cultures
(LaPensée
et
al.,
2022;
Land,
2020;
Miner ,
2022).
Although
we
are
seeing
growth
in
Indigenous
game
developers,
there
is
a
need
for
more
21
CARE
Statement
for

Indigenous
representation
in
the
technology
industry
to
ensure
that
Indigenous
perspectives
and
values
are
incorporated
into
the
design
and
development
of
digital
spaces.
This
can
be
achieved
through
initiatives
that
prioritize
Indigenous
hiring
and
training
programs,
as
well
as
funding
for
Indigenous-led
technology
projects.
Finally ,
protecting
Indigenous
names
and
languages
from
digital
harassment
and
structural
oppression
is
crucial.
This
includes
measures
such
as
the
development
of
tools
for
reporting
and
removing
harmful
content,
as
well
as
education
and
awareness
campaigns
to
promote
respect
for
Indigenous
languages
and
cultures.
Accountability
for
discrimination
and
misleading
content
is
an
integral
aspect
of
creating
safe
digital
spaces
for
Indigenous
Peoples.
Platforms
and
developers
must
take
proactive
steps
to
prevent
the
creation
and
dissemination
of
harmful
content
and
work
in
partnership
with
Indigenous
communities
to
create
content
that
is
respectful
and
accurate.
T o
realize
its
commitments
to
introduce
accountability
criteria
for
discrimination
and
misleading
content,
the
Global
Digital
Compact
should:
●
Protect
Indigenous
names
and

from
digital

and
structural
oppression.
●
Establish
national,
regional,
and
global
accountability
mechanisms
that
track
Indigenous
hiring
and
training
programs
in
the
technology
industry .
●
Develop
tools
for
reporting
and
removing
harmful
content
targeting
Indigenous
names
and
languages.
●
Develop
and
implement
comprehensive

moderation
policies
that
specifically
address

●
Hold

accountable
for
the

they
host
and
its

Pr omote
Regulation
of
Artificial
Intelligence
Advancements
in
technology
include
rapidly
expanding
Artificial
Intelligence
(AI).
Modeling
Indigenous
epistemologies,
by
treating
non-human
kin
such
as
AI
and
other
computational
creations,
with
respect
and
as
kin
,
can
increase
the
chances
that
all
kin
will
flourish
(Lewis
et
al.,
2018).
However ,
if
ethical
relationships
with
AI
are
not
established
early
on,
the
development
and
use
of
AI
technology
have
significant
implications
for
Indigenous
rights,
including
intellectual
property
rights,
privacy
and
data
protection,
and
cultural
and
linguistic
preservation.
As
AI
systems
generate,
collect,
and
process
vast
amounts
of
data,
it
becomes
imperative
to
protect
Indigenous
knowledge
and
intellectual
property
rights.
Additionally ,
the
use
of
AI
must
be
subject
to
stringent
privacy
and
data
protection
standards
to
prevent
the
misuse
of
personal
information.
Finally ,
the
use
of
AI
must
also
take
into
account
the
importance
of
cultural
and
22
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data

linguistic
preservation
for
Indigenous
Peoples
(Holton
et
al.,
2022).
Although
AI
is
increasingly
being
integrated
into
various
aspects
of
our
lives,
including
in
areas
such
as
healthcare,
education,
and
finance,
it
is
necessary
to
implement
regulations
on
AI.
Without
regulations,
AI
has
the
capability
to
infringe
upon
human
rights
-
including
compromising
IDSov .
To
address
these
challenges,
there
is
a
need
for
regulatory
frameworks
and
guidelines
for
the
development
and
use
of
AI
that
align
with
the
principles
of
IDSov
and
Indigenous
rights.
In
2020,
the
Indigenous
Protocol
and
Artificial
Intelligence
Working
Group
developed
a
position
paper
on
“
Indigenous
Protocol
and
Artificial
Intelligence
”
in
which
they
developed
guidelines
for
Indigenous-centered
AI
de
sign
(Lewis
et
al.,
2020).
W
e
encourage
the
GDC
to
adopt
many
of
the
pivotal
recommendations
put
forward
in
the
position
paper
at
an
international
level.
However ,
Indigenous
protocols
for
AI
development
and
use
must
also
be
developed
and
adopted
on
a
local
and
regional
ba
sis
(Abdilla
et
al.,
2021).
T
his
includes
ensuring
that
AI
systems
are
designed
and
used
in
ways
that
respect
Indigenous
laws
and
the
cultural
and
linguistic
diversity
of
Indigenous
Peoples,
and
that
they
do
not
perpetuate
existing
biases
or
inequalities
(Roxanne,
2019;
Tapu
and
Fa’agau,
2022
).
Rece
ntly,
Munn
(2023)
applied
Māori
principles
to
evaluate
AI
design
processes
and
concluded
that
(1)
Indigenous
metrics
for
AI
are
needed;
(2)
AI
design
must
be
decolonized;
and
(3)
co-optation
of
Indigenous
values
avoided.
According
t
o
Munn
(2023),
Indigenous
principles
are
not
a
smorgasbord
where
principles
can
be
chosen
as
desired.
In
the
same
vein,
splicing
one
or
two
concepts
into
a
broader
framework
of
Western
values
too
often
leaves
them
watered
down
or
tokenistic.
It
would
be
easy
for
governments
and
corporations
to
gain
social
and
cultural
prestige
by
superficially
parroting
some
of
these
values
without
any
significant
commitment
behind
them—indeed,
we
see
such
a
pattern
repeatedly
in
the
pa
st.
(p.
7)
The
GDC
must
encourage
governments
and
corporations
to
prioritize
Indigenous-led
AI
development
and
Indigenous-centered
AI
design
to
protect
against
misuse
and
misappropriation
of
Indigenous
knowledge
systems.
Moreover ,
there
is
a
need
to
address
potential
intellectual
malpractices
that
may
arise
with
the
use
of
AI,
particularly
in
relation
to
the
protection
of
Indigenous
knowledge
and
cultural
expressions.
There
are
also
potential
risks
associated
with
the
use
of
AI
technologies
for
Indigenous
communi
ties
(Irwin,
2019).
One
risk
is
that
AI
systems
may
perpetuate
existing
biases
and
discrimination
against
Indigenous
P
eoples
(Whaanga,
2022).
F
or
example,
if
AI
systems
are
trained
on
biased
data
sets,
they
may
produce
biased
outputs
that
perpetuate
discrimination
against
Indigenous
comm
unities
(Roxanne,
2019).
Add
itionally ,
AI
systems
may
be
used
to
automate
decision-making
processes
that
should
be
made
by
humans,
leading
to
a
loss
of
human
agency
and
control
over
important
decisions.
This
requires
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
23
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
implications
of
AI
for
Indigenous
rights,
which
can
be
achieved
through
conducting
global
studies
and
engaging
in
dialogue
with
Indigenous
communities.
There
are
several
concerns
related
to
AI
regulation
for
Indigenous
Peoples,
particularly
with
the
advancement
of
emer ging
technologies
such
as
quantum
computing,
robotics,
more
powerful
and
inclusive
language
translators,
conversational
AI
and
assistants,
generative
and
multi-modal
AI,
robotics,
driverless
cars,
and
other
areas
that
AI
research
teams
continue
to
work
on
(
Lewis
et
al.,
2020)
.
The
potential
for
AI
is
already
being
demonstrated.
For
example,
a
newly
released
Artificial
Intelligence
ChatGPT
(Chat
Generative
Pre-trained
Transformer)
by
OpenAI
has
successfully
passed
(60%)
the
United
States
Medical
Licensing
Exam
(USMLE)
(Kung
et
al.,
2023).
Similarly ,
created
and
trained
on
biomedical
domain
literature,
PubMedGPT ,
a
counterpart
to
ChatGPT ,
achieved
an
accuracy
rate
of
50.3%
(Kung
et
al.,
2023).
Its
ability
for
AI
to
breach
systems
is
unknown
-
but
it
is
likely
that
superintelligence
is
unable
to
be
contained
(Alfonseca
et
al.,
2021).
One
of
the
primary
concerns
is
the
potential
for
these
technologies
to
exacerbate
existing
power
imbalances
and
inequalities
between
Indigenous
Peoples
and
non-Indigenous
communities.
Additionally ,
there
is
a
risk
that
these
technologies
may
not
be
developed
or
implemented
in
a
culturally
sensitive
or
appropriate
way,
leading
to
unintended
negative
consequences
for
Indigenous
Peoples
(
Abdilla,
2021).
For
exampl
e,
ChatGPT
when
asked
to
define
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
draws
on
correct
information
but
fails
to
provide
correct
attribution,
furthering
Indigenous
erasure
and
digital
extractive
colonialism.
Therefore,
it
is
imperative
that
AI
regulations
are
developed
in
consultation
with
Indigenous
communities
and
take
into
account
their
unique
cultural
and
social
contexts
to
ensure
that
these
technologies
are
used
in
a
way
that
benefits
everyone.
AI
has
the
potential
to
advance
a
wide
range
of
rights,
including
environmental,
economic,
social,
cultural,
civil,
and
political
rights.
However ,
it
is
equally
important
to
acknowledge
that
AI
can
also
pose
significant
risks
to
these
rights
and
can
exacerbate
existing
inequalities
and
discrimination.
A
study
by
Robinson
et
al.
(2022)
investigated
the
potential
for
AI
to
perform
“analytical
modeling
to
assess
and
monitor
ecosystems”,
specifically
monitoring
the
Nardab,
a
culturally
significant
wetland
in
Kakadu
National
Park,
especially
for
the
Bininj
Peoples.
Results
suggest
that
through
codesign,
AI
can
be
integrated
accordingly
to
ensure
on-the-ground
decisions
reflect
the
traditional
and
scientific
methodologies
that
are
culturally
respective
of
the
socio-ecological
systems
inclusive
of
Indigenous
Peoples
(Robinson
et
al.,
2022).
Similarly ,
Wolf
(2019)
expresses
how
AI
has
the
capacity
to
advance
“cultural
and
linguistic
revitalization”,
ultimately
empowering
Indigenous
Peoples
and
safeguarding
knowledge
for
future
generations.
Thus,
while
AI
presents
potential
benefits,
it
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
its
development
and
application
are
balanced
with
the
protection
of
Indigenous
rights.
As
demonstrated
by
Robinson
et
al.
(2022)
and
Wolf
(2019),
codesigning
AI
systems
with
24
CARE

Indigenous

can
lead
to

and
revitalization
of
Indigenous

However ,
implementing
AI
policies
that
prevent
bias
and
prioritize
Indigenous
rights
is
vital
to
avoid
exacerbating
existing
power
imbalances
and
perpetuating
digital

The
three-week-long
summer
program
provides
Indigenous
high
school
students
with
hands-on
experience
in
developing
personalized
mobile
applications
using
industry-standard
software
engineering
practices,
computer
science,
deep
learning,
and
extended
reality
(LAICC,
2023).
Through
this
program,
Indigenous
youth
gain
the
skills
and
knowledge
necessary
to
engage
with
AI
in
a
way
that
aligns
with
Indigenous
values
and
principles.
Moreover ,
the
program
aims
to
inspire
Indigenous
students
to
pursue
pathways
into
higher
education
and
careers
in
advanced
technology
fields
(LAICC,
2023).
The
LAICC
represents
an
important
step
towards
ensuring
that
Indigenous
Peoples
are
not
only
included
but
also
empowered
in
the
development
and
implementation
of
AI
technologies
(LAICC,
2023).
To
align
AI
development
and
use
with
Indigenous
values
and
principles,
IDSov
must
be
prioritized
by
AI
developers
and
policymakers.
This
involves
respecting
Indigenous
communities'
right
to
control
and
protect
their
data.
To
achieve
this
goal,
Indigenous
experts
must
guide
AI
development
and
use,
and
Indigenous
communities
should
participate
in
the
decision-making
process.
As
AI
becomes
increasingly
integrated
into
society ,
it
i
s
imperative
to
ensure
that
its
development
and
use
align
with
Indigenous
values
and
principles.
Policymakers
should
also
prioritize
the
incorporation
of
Indigenous
rights
and
perspectives
in
regulatory
frameworks
and
legislation
surrounding
AI.
Failure
to
incorporate
IDSov
in
AI
development
and
use
risks
perpetuating
historical
injustic
es
and
further
eroding
Indigenous
Peoples'
rights
and
sovereignty
(Caroll
et
al.,
2020;
Tsosie,
2020).
Shedlock
and
Hudson
(2022)
u
nderscore
the
immediate
danger
of
AI
that
excludes
Indigenous
knowledge
systems
and
advocate
for
a
new
model
“Māori
IT
Artefacts”
built
upon
Kaupapa
Māori
(Māori
principles
and
ideas
which
act
as
a
base
for

The
authors
further
emphasize
the
urgency
many
Indigenous
Peoples
currently
feel
with
the
rapid
progression
of
AI
forcing
Indigenous
technologists
and
government
leaders
into
“fight
mode”
to
protect
their
sovereignty ,
ways
of
knowing
and
being,
and
rights
to

T
hus,
there
is
a
need
for
Indigenous-led
regulation
of
AI
that
prioritizes
the
protection
of
IDSov .
The
potential
for
Indigenous-led
AI
regulation
is
promising,
but
it
also
faces
challenges.
One
challenge
is
the
lack
of
resources
and
infrastructure
for
Indigenous
communities
to
lead
AI
development
and
regulation.
Another
challenge
is
the
need
for
non-Indigenous
researchers
and
developers
to
engage
in
meaningful
and
respectful
consultation
with
Indigenous
communities
when
new
AI
instruments
are
being
conceptualized.
It
is
essential
to
have
Indigenous
leaders
in
25

AI
and
developers
who
possess
firsthand
experience
and
knowledge
of
diverse
Indigenous
epistemologies.
This
ensures
that
AI
systems
incorporate
Indigenous
values
and
follow
the
required
protocols
for
cultural
expansion
in
these
new
technological
space
s
(Kesserwan,
2018)
.
Indigenous
Nations,
alongside
other
governments,
will
have
to
create
dedicated
laws
for
the
regulation
of
AI
in
line
with
their
Indigenous
values
and
lega
l
systems
(Abdilla
et
al.,
2021;
Maitra,
2020).
The
need
for
Indigenous-led
regulation
of
AI
arises
from
the
historical
and
ongoing
colonization
and
exploitation
of
Indigenous
knowledge
and
data.
Indigenous
communities
have
long
been
subjected
to
extractive
research
practices,
where
researchers
and
corporations
collect
data
and
knowledge
without
consent,
often
leading
to
the
exploitation
of
Indigenous
Peoples
and
communities.
The
development
and
use
of
AI
systems
without
Indigenous
input
or
consent
can
exacerbate
this
harm
(Abdilla,
2021;
Shedlock
and
Hudson,
2022).
Ultimately ,
AI
regulatory
frameworks
and
guidelines
must
be
designed
in
consultation
with
Indigenous
Peoples
and
be
guided
by
the
principles
of
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty ,
Indigenous
rights,
and
the
UNDRIP .
By
doing
so,
we
can
ensure
that
the
benefits
of
AI
are
realized
in
ways
that
are
inclusive
and
respectful
of
the
rights
and
values
of
all
people,
including
Indigenous
Peoples.
T o
realize
its
commitments
to
promote
the
regulation
of
artificial
intelligence,
the
Global
Digital
Compact
should:
●
Develop
regulatory
frameworks
and
guidelines
for
the
development
and
use
of
AI
that
align
with
Indigenous
data
sovereignty
and
Indigenous
rights.
●
Ensure
that
AI
systems
are
designed
and
used
in
ways
that
respect
the
cultural
and
linguistic
diversity
of
Indigenous
Peoples
and
do
not
perpetuate
existing
biases
or
inequalities.
●
Address
potential
intellectual
malpractices
that
may
arise
with
the
use
of
AI,
particularly
in
relation
to
the
protection
of
Indigenous
knowledge
and
cultural
expressions.
●
Conduct
studies
and
engage
in
dialogue
with
Indigenous
communities
to
achieve
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
implications
of
AI
for
Indigenous
rights.
●
Encourage
governments
at
national,
regional,
and
global
levels
to
develop
AI
regulations
in
consultation
with
Indigenous
communities
and
take
into
account
their
unique
cultural
and
social
contexts
to
ensure
that
these
technologies
are
used
in
a
way
that
benefits
everyone.
●
Promote
Indigenous
involvement
in
the
development
and
implementation
of
AI
technologies
through
Indigenous
youth
STEM
programs
like
the
Lakota
AI
Code

Digital
Commons
as
a
Global
Public
Good
The
Digital
Commons
as
a
Public
Good
is
concerning
for
Indigenous
Peoples
and
Indigenous
data
governance
scientists
working
to
protect
the
ownership,
control,
and
use
of
Indigenous
data
and
knowledge.
Firstly ,
the
phrasing
“Digital
Commons
as
a
Public
Good”
is
ambiguous
and
lacks
clarity
of
intent
and
purpose
when
discussed
by
Indigenous
data
sovereignty
experts.
Some
put
forward
the
idea
of
“digital
public
goods”
as
one
conceptual
lens
through
which
to
vision
the
potential
GDC
concept
of
a
digital
commons.
Digital
Public
Goods
include:
“open
source
software,
open
data,
open
artificial
intelligence
models,
open
standards
and
open
content”
(UN,
2020).
While
the
potential
benefits
of
Digital
Public
Goods,
such
as
open
source
software,
open
data,
and
open
artificial
intelligence
models,
can
be
significant,
Indigenous
communities
are
rightly
concerned
about
the
potential
for
their
data
and
knowledge
to
be
misused
or
exploited.
There
is
also
a
concern
that
open
standards
and
open
content
may
not
adequately
reflect
Indigenous
cultural
values
and
priorities.
Indigenous
communities
and
leadership
(i.e.,
traditional/cultural
leaders,
tribal
governing
entities),
are
calling
for
greater
control
over
their
data
and
knowledge,
and
for
the
development
of
culturally
appropriate
governance
frameworks
that
take
into
account
their
unique
perspectives
and
concerns
(Campbell,
2018;
Caroll
et
al.,
2019;
Sporle
et
al.,
2020;
Tsosie
et
al.,
2021;
Walter
et
al.,
2021).
This
includes
ensuring
that
Indigenous
communities
have
a
say
in
how
digital
commons
are
created,
accessed,
and
used;
that
these
goods
are
designed
and
governed
in
ways
that
reflect
Indigenous
values
and
priorities;
and
that
the
benefits
of
digital
commons
accrue
to
Indigenous
communities.
Despite
the
potential
benefits
of
public
goods
in
the
context
of
emer ging
technologies,
Indigenous
Peoples
have
legitimate
concerns
about
the
use
of
the
term
"public"
in
this
context.
This
is
due
to
a
history
of
disregard
for
Indigenous
rights
and
ownership
of
resources
in
the
creation
of
public
goods
(Birkinbine
and
Kidd,
2020;
Kidd,
2020).
One
example
is
the
U.S.
Homestead
Act
of
1862,
which
allowed
American
settlers
to
claim
up
to
160
acres
of
surveyed
government
land
without
consideration
of
Indigenous
land
claims
(NPS,
2021).
Or
how
many
existing
National
Parks
and
Protected
Areas
were
created
by
illegally
taking
Indigenous
lands
and
waters
to
reclassify
them
in
the
commons
as
“public
goods”
for
settler
enjoyment
while
at
the
same
time
prohibiting
Indigenous
Peoples’
access
and
stewardship
(Domínguez
and
Luoma,
2020;
Kohn,
2020).
More
recently ,
approaches
to
public
health
at
national
levels
that
do
not
consider
Indigenous
Peoples
as
socio-political
collectives
dilute
the
effectiveness
of
engagement
and
interventions
in
Indigenous
communities
(Anderson
et
al.,
2016;
Bauer
and
Plescia,
2014;
Hudson
et
al.,
2020;
Reid
et
al.,
2019).
In
other
words,
although
“public
good”
often
carries
a
sense
of
solidarity
in
global
and
national
policy ,
it
can
also
be
a
tool
for
dominance,
assimilation,
and
erasure
without
a
robust,
underlying
infrastructure
of
Indigenous
self-determination
(e.g.,
UNDRIP).
Especially
with
the
GDC,
in
which
the
digital
world
seems
inescapably
“common”
because
of
its
connective
power ,
discussions
of
public
goods
need
to
account
for
this
dynamic.
27
CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
In
the
context
of
discussions
about
public
goods
and
the
digital
world,
one
area
that
has
gained
increasing
attention
is
that
of
open
data.
Open
data
is
a
concept
that
advocates
for
the
unrestricted
sharing
of
structured
data
that
can
be
accessed,
used,
and
built
upon
without
limitations.
This
movement
has
gained
popularity
in
recent
years
due
to
the
potential
benefits
it
brings
to
scientific
research
and
innovation.
However ,
the
open
data
movement
has
been
criticized
for
not
fully
considering
Indigenous
Peoples'
rights
and
interests
(GIDA,
2022a).
“Indigenous
data
sovereignty
(IDS)
provides
a
framework
for
maximizing
the
benefit
of
open
data
for
Indigenous
Peoples
and
other
users
of
Indigenous
data
and
for
affecting
the
stewardship
of
all
data”
(Rainie
et
al.,
2019).
Indigenous
data
sovereignty
(IDSov)
recognizes
that
Indigenous
Peoples
have
unique
rights
and
responsibilities
regarding
the
collection,
use,
and
dissemination
of
data
(Walter
et
al.,
2021).
IDSov
emphasizes
the
importance
of
data
governance
that
is
grounded
in
Indigenous
knowledge,
values,
and
ethics.
According
to
Walter
et
al.
(2021),
open
data
infrastructures
and
processes
must
be
inclusive
of
Indigenous
Peoples
as
decision-makers
and
empower
existing
IDSov
networks
to
co-develop
open
data
policies.
To
operationalize
the
FAIR
Guiding
Principles
with
CARE
Principles
for
Indigenous
Data
Governance,
the
GDC
must
consider
the
power
dynamics
and
historical
contexts
that
have
shaped
data
collection
and
sharing
practices.
This
requires
engaging
with
Indigenous
communities
in
a
meaningful
and
respectful
way
and
acknowledging
their
rights
to
control
and
act
on
their
governance
over
data,
especially
in
transitions
to
open
data
as
a
digital
commons.
Overall,
it
is
important
to
balance
the
benefits
of
open
data
and
the
digital
commons
with
the
need
to
protect
Indigenous
data
and
uphold
Indigenous
Peoples'
rights
and
interests.
By
incorporating
IDSov
principles
and
engaging
in
ethical
and
collaborative
IDGov
practices,
we
can
work
towards
a
more
equitable
and
just
approach
to
data
sharing
and
use.
T o
realize
its
commitments
to
digital
commons
as
a
public
good,
the
Global
Digital
Compact
should:
●
Prioritize
the
development
of
culturally
relevant/responsive
data
governance
frameworks
that
take
into
account
Indigenous
perspectives
and
concerns
and
operationalize
CARE
Principles.
●
Ensure
Indigenous
Peoples
and
communities
have
a
say
in
how
digital
commons
are
defined,
created,
accessed,
and
used.
●
Encourage
governments
at
national,
regional,
and
global
levels
to
recognize
the
history
of
disregard
for
Indigenous
rights
and
ownership
of
resources
in
the
creation
of
public
goods
and
create
solutions
to
not
replicate
historical
wrongs
in
future
digital
spaces.
●
Ensure
the
benefits
of
digital
commons
accrue
to
Indigenous
Peoples
and
communities.

Spectrum
Sover eignty
Indigenous
Peoples
have
been
disproportionately
impacted
by
the
misallocation
of
wireless
spectrum
without
their
free,
prior ,
and
informed
consent.
Therefore,
it
is
crucial
that
the
Global
Digital
Compact
(GDC)
makes
commitments
to
spectrum
sovereignty
in
order
to
promote
the
rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples
and
ensure
equitable
access
to
digital
spaces
and
technologies.
“Spectrum
sovereignty”
refers
to
the
concept
of
Indigenous
Peoples’
rights,
treaties,
laws,
and
jurisdiction
including
digital
spaces
and
emer ging
metaverses
(Blackwater
et
al.,
2022;
Gagnon,
2021;
Wheelock,
2022).
This
includes
the
right
to
manage
and
regulate
the
use
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
that
exists
across
sovereign
Indigenous
lands
(Blackwater
et
al.,
2022).
Spectrum
sovereignty
is
based
on
the
recognition
that
Indigenous
Peoples
have
unique
knowledge
and
cultural
practices
that
are
closely
tied
to
the
land,
and
that
the
extraction
of
raw
materials
for
the
development
and
continued
use
of
digital
technologies
can
have
significant
impacts
on
Indigenous
environments,
cultural
practices
and
on
the
health
of
Indigenous
communities.
As
such,
spectrum
sovereignty
is
a
component
of
IDSov
and
Indigenous
rights
more
broadly .
Principles
of
spectrum
sovereignty
also
extend
to
blockchain
technology ,
as
the
decentralized
nature
of
blockchain
networks
requires
a
certain
level
of
spectrum
control
for
proper
functioning.
Blockchain
and
some
of
the
newer
technologies
found
building
WEB
3.0
have
vast
implications
for
Indigenous
Peoples’
sovereignty .
However ,
Mackey
et
al.
(2022)
noted
that
there
are
at
least
three
areas
where
blockchain
technology
fills
these
voids
in
Tribal
genetic
research
governance.
They
include:
1.
Individual
and
collective
data
ownership,
access,
and
privileges;
2.
Establishing
rules,
roles,
and
responsibilities
that
govern
systems;
and,
3.
Enabling
community
engagement
and
data
management
for
community
consensus
for
validations.
Through
blockchain
ledgers
and
smart
contracts,
principles
of
traditional
knowledge
and
IDSov
can
be
built
straight
into
digital
programming.
If
and
when
Tribes
can
incorporate
using
some
of
these
newer
technologies
they
will
be
capable
of
an
extra
layer
of
protection
within
the
digital
realm
and
potentially
from
any
AI
that
may
act
as
a
threat
to
a
Nation’ s
spectrum
sovereignty ,
including
as
an
Indigenous
data
thief
or
spy
(Lewis
et
al.,
2020;
Mackey
et
al.,
2022).
There
have
been
reports
of
Bitcoin
owners
using
cryptocurrency
to
purchase
Indigenous
lands,
leading
to
concerns
about
the
facilitation
of
land
grabs
(Clarke,
2022).
This
financial
colonial
trend
raises
serious
ethical,
legal,
and
social
implications
for
Indigenous
Peoples'
rights
to
land
and
self-determination
(Glancy ,
2022;
Ongweso,
2021)
.
The
use
of
cryptocurrency
and
blockchain
technology
in
this
manner
highlights
the
need
for
greater
transparency
and
accountability
in
the
emer ging
digital
economy .
It
is
crucial
to
ensure
that
Indigenous
Peoples'
rights
are
respected
in
the
development
and
use
of
these
technologies
and
to
involve
Indigenous
communities
in
the
design
and
implementation
of
regulatory
frameworks
to
protect
their
lands,
resources,
and
cultures.
It
is
also
important
to
recognize
and
support
the
sovereignty
of
29
CARE

Indigenous
Nations
and
their
right
to

and
manage
their
lands
and
resources
free
from
blockchain
land
grabs.
Moreover ,
it
is
necessary
to
consider
the
locations
of
future
data
centers,
especially
in
consideration
of
climate
change
shifts
to
water -stressed
regions
(Siddik
et
al.,
2021).
The
environmental
footprints
of
data
centers
are
disproportionately
impacting
water -stressed
areas
in
the
U.S.
Southwest,
where
a
large
percentage
of
Tribal
Nations
live.
Thus,
it
is
vital
to
consider
the
locations
of
future
data
centers
through
the
lens
of
Indigenous
Sovereignty
ensuring
their
development
does
not
violate
Indigenous
Peoples’
right
to
free,
prior
and
informed
consent.
T o
realize
its
commitments
to
Spectrum

the
Global
Digital

should:
●
Recognize
and
respect
Indigenous
Peoples'
rights
to
spectrum

that
exist
across
their
sovereign
lands
and

including
in
digital

and
emer ging

●
Incorporate
principles
of
IDSov
and
IDGov
into
digital
programming
through
blockchain
ledgers
and
smart

●
Encourage
governments
to
assign
unused
wireless
spectrum
to
Indigenous
communities
●
Ensure
greater
transparency
and
accountability
in
the
emer ging
digital

involving
Indigenous
communities
in
the
design
and

of
regulatory
frameworks
to
protect
their

●
Recognize
and

of
Indigenous

and
their
right
to

●
Consider
the
locations
of
future

centers
through
the
lens
of
Indigenous
Sovereignty ,
especially
in
water -stressed
regions
where
increasing
digital

development
without

threatens
Indigenous

CARE
Statement
for
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
April
2023
Summary
The
importance
of
recognizing
the
collective
effort
needed
for
change
and
prioritizing
equity ,
particularly
in
partnership
with
Indigenous
Peoples
and
communities,
cannot
be
overstated.
Ultimately ,
the
Global
Digital
Compact
must
not
only
be
inclusive
of
but
must
prioritize
equity ,
especially
in
partnership
with
Indigenous
Peoples
and
communities,
which
can
be
actualized
through
the
recognition
of
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
and
prioritization
and
integration
of
the
CARE
Principles
for
Indigenous
Data
Governance.
In
this
submission
we
present
recommendations
for
the
Global
Digital
Compact
to
achieve
its
commitments
related
to
Internet
connectivity ,
Internet
fragmentation,
data
protection,
human
rights
online,
accountability
criteria
for
discrimination
and
misleading
content,
regulation
of
artificial
intelligence,
and
digital
commons
as
a
public
good.
These
recommendations
emphasize
the
importance
of
acknowledging
and
incorporating
Indigenous
rights,
perspectives
and
concerns
in
the
development
and
governance
of
digital
systems.
We
recommend
investing
in
infrastructure
development,
increasing
funding
and
resources
for
Indigenous
schools
and
educational
institutions,
protecting
the
rights
of
Indigenous
Peoples’
in
the
digital
space,
establishing
Indigenous
Data
Sovereignty
as
a
right
to
govern,
steward,
and
control
our
own
data,
and
ensuring
that
AI
systems
are
designed
and
used
in
ways
that
respect
the
cultural
and
linguistic
diversity
of
Indigenous
Peoples.
Additionally ,
the
submission
highlights
the
importance
of
prioritizing
the
development
of
culturally
appropriate
data
governance
frameworks
and
ensuring
that
Indigenous
Peoples
and
communities
have
a
say
in
how
digital
commons
are
defined,
created,
accessed,
and
used.
