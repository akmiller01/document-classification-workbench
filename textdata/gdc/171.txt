Al
Sur ’ s
Submission
to
the 
Global
Digital
Compact: 
perspectives
from
Latin 
America
April,
2023
I.
About
Al
Sur
Al
Sur
is
a
consortium
of
11
organizations
of
civil
society
and
academia
in
Latin
America
working
towards
strengthening
human
rights
in
the
region's
digital
environment.
1
Its
main
purpose
is
to
build
a
space
in
which
Latin
American
civil
society
can
deepen
their
understanding
of
critical
aspects,
emer ging
trends
and
opportunities
related
to
digital
technologies
and
act
in
a
coordinated
and
strategic
manner
to
influence
decision-making
from
a
perspective
that
is
sensitive
to
the
diversity
of
gender ,
race,
ethnicity
and
class.
II.
About
this
submission
Latin
American
countries
are
affected
by
persistent
inequalities
that
continue
in
the
digital
era
and
have
even
greater
effects
on
vulnerable
populations.
If
those
are
not
taken
into
account
within
decision-making
related
to
digital
and
internet
governance,
technology
might
deepen
such
inequalities
instead
of
being
instrumental
to
promote
change
and
achieve
the
Sustainable
Development
Goals
(SDGs).
The
Global
Digital
Compact
(GDC)
is
a
key
opportunity
to
generate
a
global
digital
agenda
that
takes
into
account
the
inequities
and
challenges
that
affect
Latin
America
as
well
as
the
knowledge
and
experiences
from
the
region.
As
part
of
a
Global
South
consortium,
Al
Sur
organizations
are
aware
that
the
problems
related
to
digital
technologies
have
differentiated
impacts
in
our
societies.
Such
problems
and
impacts
need
to
be
considered
within
the
formulation
of
a
GDC.
Al
Sur’s
submission
includes
contributions
on
the
following
suggested
topics:
apply
human
rights
online,
connect
all
people
to
the
internet
including
schools,
protect
data,
and
promote
regulation
of
artificial
intelligence.
The
contributions
were
drafted
after
a
series
of
collective
meetings
and
joint
action
building
from
the
experience
of
the
eleven
aforementioned
members
working
on
human
rights
and
technology
issues.
The
contribution
summarizes
six
years
of
trajectory
and
joint
reflection
on
the
challenges,
realities,
lessons
learned
and
proposals
systematized
in
more
than
20
collective
publications
available
in
English,
Portuguese
and
Spanish.

A p p l y
h u m a n
r i g h t s
o n l i n e
At
a
time
of
accelerated
growth
of
internet
connectivity
and
an
increasingly
intensive
use
of
digital
technologies
–
including
within
the
public
sector
pushed
by
the
isolation
measures
adopted
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
–,
compliance
with
and
protection
of
human
rights
in
digital
environments
is
one
of
the
greatest
challenges
for
national,
regional
and
global
agendas.
Greater
commitments
are
urgent
to
assure
that
policies
and
practices
related
to
the
digital
sphere
incorporate
decades
of
advances
in
the
recognition
of
human
rights
standards
which
have
been
updated
and
reinforced
considering
the
particularities
of
such
specific
context.
The
Global
Digital
Compact
has
a
key
role
in
this
regard,
to
influence
stakeholders
to
assume
a
greater
commitment
and
responsibility
regarding
the
recognition
of
human
rights
online
at
the
individual
and
collective
levels.
From
this
perspective,
this
contribution
focuses
on
the
rights
to
freedom
of
expression
and
privacy
as
key
enabling
rights
online.
1.a
Freedom
of
expression
Access
to
the
internet
is
essential
to
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
freedom
of
expression,
including
access
to
information,
and
to
a
series
of
related
fundamental
rights.
Besides
persistent
digital
divides,
freedom
of
expression
online
continues
to
be
limited
in
various
forms
in
Latin
America.
3
Restrictions
are
both
direct
and
indirect:
on
the
one
hand
with
rules
and
practices
that
impose
censorship
to
legitimate
content
or
with
internet
disruptions,
for
instance.
On
the
other
with
the
spread
of
online
violence,
hate
and
the
use
of
surveillance
technologies
to
target
journalists
and
human
rights
defenders,
as
identified
in
several
Latin
American
countries
(see
1.b),
and
as
key
drivers
of
self-censorship.
Internet
disruptions
have
been
reported
in
several
Latin
American
countries,
particularly
in
the
context
of
protests
as
identified
in
recent
cases
in
Colombia
and
Ecuador .
4
Beyond
full
national
internet
shutdowns,
the
interruption
of
the
operation
of
specific
services
or
at
specific
regions
has
raised
concerns
over
the
manner
in
which
information
flows
can
be
controlled
by
states
and
private
entities.
Such
incidents
affecting
internet
infrastructure
are
not
usually
easy
to
detect
but
imply
concrete
impacts
to
affected
groups,
such
as
in
the
case
of
the
blocking
of
a
website
with
4
APC
and
Derechos
Digitales,
“Internet
shutdowns
and
human
rights”
at 
https://www.derechosdigitales.org/wp-content/uploads/internet_shutdowns_and_human_rights_ohchr_submi

information
on
sexual
and
reproductive
rights
in
Brazil.
5
Besides
affecting
legitimate
content
in
a
number
of
cases,
they
are
often
a
result
of
interpretations
or
norms
that
are
not
in
line
with
international
standards
on
freedom
of
expression.
Online
gender
based
violence
(OGBV)
has
been
a
key
concern
in
the
region
with
female
journalists,
activists
and
political
figures
as
a
priority
target
for
online
harassment
and
attacks
in
clear
attempts
to
silence
their
voices
and
discourage
their
possibility
to
participate
in
public
discussions
taking
place
online.
It
is
important
to
recall
at
the
same
time
that
while
online
forms
of
political
gender
based
violence
expand
previous
and
offline
violence,
their
impact
goes
beyond
the
online
environment,
as
recognized
by
the
MESECVI
and
UN
Women
6
”.
Recommendations
for
the
Global
Digital
Compact
●
Concrete
measures
and
monitoring
mechanisms
should
be
put
in
place
to
eradicate
all
forms
of
violence
against
journalists
and
human
rights
defenders,
including
within
online
environments
or
with
assistance
of
digital
technologies
including
spyware.
●
Limitations
to
freedom
of
expression
online
should
follow
the
same
standards
as
offline
limitations
and,
therefore,
be
established
by
law
and
comply
with
the
conditions
necessary
for
their
application
according
to
the
three-part
test:
they
must
be
appropriate,
necessary
and
proportionate.
●
Global,
regional
and
local
decision-making
processes
regarding
defining
concepts
that
may
potentially
restrict
freedom
of
expression
online
should
include
wide
multi-stakeholder
participation
processes.
○
The
GDC
should
create
mechanisms
for
coordinated
dialogue
that
include
the
different
instances
trying
to
advance
concepts,
standards
and
frameworks
on
the
matter
–including
efforts
to
fight
online
gender
based
violence,
desinformation
and
others
at
the
UN
level–,
and
foster
leaders
and
participants
of
such
initiatives
to
engage
in
existing
multi-stakeholder
spaces
such
as
the
Internet
Governance
Forum
(IGF)
and
its
regional
and
national
processes
(NRIs).
○
All
UN
bodies
involved
in
decision-making
processes
that
might
have
implications
for
freedom
of
expression
online
should
consider
existing
human
rights
standards,
frameworks
and
criteria,
including
the
three-part
test.
The
Special
Rapporteur
on
Freedom
of
Expression
should
be
involved
and
able
to
review
any
proposals
that
might
affect
freedom
of
expression
online
originating
from
any
UN
body .
●
Online
platform
providers
should
include
mechanisms
to
account
for
cultural
and
contextual
diversity
in
their
content
moderation
policies
and
practices
and
adopt

as
well
as

should

and
no

●
High

mechanisms
should
be
established
to
guarantee
network

and
that
States
and
private

companies
respect
the
free
flow
of

online.
●
Full
or
partial
internet
disruptions
pose
serious
challenges
to
the
exercise
of
a
wide
range
of
rights
and
should
be
avoided.
Any
measure
that
restricts
people's
ability
to
fully
connect
to
the
internet
should
be
strictly
justified
through
the
principles
of
proportionality
and
necessity .
●
Anonymous
and
pseudonymous
discourses
should
be
protected
as
key
mechanisms
for
the
exercise
of
freedom
of
expression
online.
1.b
Surveillance
In
the
digital
age,
the
right
to
privacy
has
become
a
gateway
to
the
protection
of
other
rights
7
and
therefore
requires
strong
protection
as
"a
necessary
precondition
for
the
protection
of
fundamental
values,
including
liberty ,
dignity ,
equality",
and
"an
essential
element
for
democratic
societies".
8
The
right
to
privacy
can
be
restricted
only
in
"a
carefully
circumscribed
manner".
Interference
with
the
right
to
privacy
is
permissible
under
international
human
rights
law
as
long
as
it
is
not
arbitrary
or
unlawful.
Thus,
their
use
must
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
effectiveness
in
the
pursuit
of
a
legitimate
aim
and
strict
compliance
with
the
principles
of
legality ,
necessity
and
proportionality .
State
surveillance
has
a
considerable
impact
on
the
exercise
of
human
rights
as
it
can
lead
to
violations
of
the
right
to
privacy
and
the
right
to
freedom
of
expression,
as
well
as
allow
the
use
of
the
information
collected
for
illegitimate
and
dangerous
purposes,
including
discrimination,
persecution,
criminalization
and
violence
against
people,
causing
threats
to
the
rights
to
integrity ,
life
and
personal
freedom.
The
UN
Human
Rights
Committee’ s
General
Comment
16
on
Article
17
of
the
ICCPR
has
already
stated
that
the
arbitrary
collection
of
personal
information
by
governments
constitutes
a
highly
intrusive
act
that
“violates
the
rights
to
privacy
and
freedom
of
expression
and
may
contradict
the
principles
of
a
democratic
society”
.
9
Additionally ,
it
may
lead
to
a
chilling
effect
on
the
online
expression
of
any
individual,
which
may
derive
in
the
predominance
of
self-censorship
out
of
fear
of
being
constantly
monitored
or
tracked.

Rapporteur
on
the
Promotion
and
Protection
of
the
Right
to
Freedom
of
Opinion
and
Expression
has
already
recognized,
“surveillance
exerts
a
disproportionate
impact
on
the
freedom
of
expression
of
a
wide
range
of
vulnerable
groups,
including
racial,
religious,
ethnic,
gender
and
sexual
minorities,
members
of
certain
political
parties,
civil
society ,
human
rights
defenders,
professionals
such
as
journalists,
lawyers
and
trade
unionists,
victims
of
violence
and
abuse,
and
children”.
11
The
capacity
of
surveillance
to
produce
such
a
disproportionate
impact
becomes
particularly
relevant
considering
that,
in
recent
years,
there
has
been
an
increased
acquisition
and
use
of
commercial
surveillance
by
States
around
the
world
and
within
Latin
America,
often
without
adequate
safeguards
in
place,
resulting
in
several
cases
of
abuse,
particularly
against
human
rights
defenders,
journalists
and
activists.
This
increase
is
also
reflected
in
the
use
of
these
technologies
in
public
policies
to
address
a
wide
range
of
social
challenges
including
public
security ,
border
control,
monitoring
of
social
protests,
access
to
public
services,
and
recently
as
a
way
to
combat
the
pandemic
.
12
This
is
done
invoking
extremely
broad
purposes
such
as
security
or
public
health,
without
any
analysis
of
the
role
of
the
technology
or
prior
or
subsequent
evaluations
of
their
impact
on
fundamental
rights
13
which
makes
it
impossible
to
determine
whether
the
restriction
of
rights
was
justified
according
to
the
benefit
or
purpose
for
which
the
technology
was
implemented.
There
is
also
a
lack
of
accountability ,
control
mechanisms
and
tools,
which
undermines
the
right
of
access
to
justice.
Focusing
on
Latin
America,
several
investigations
have
shown
the
prevalence
and
usage
of
targeted
surveillance
tools,
including
malware
and
spyware,
against
activists
and
advocates,
journalists,
and
human
rights
defenders
14
and
Al Sur
has
produced
evidence
on
different
surveillance
tools
used
by
public
authorities.
For
instance,
it
has
shown
that
facial
recognition
systems
have
advanced
with
excessive
opacity
and
little
commitment
from
public
authorities
to
ensure
minimum
conditions
in
their
deployment
in
order
to
mitigate
the
impact
on
the
exercise
of
fundamental
rights.
15
The
exercise
of
illegal
surveillance
practices
has
deepened
with
the
rise
of
the
surveillance
industry
and
the
intrusive
and
sophisticated
nature
of
the
technologies
used
which
is
especially
worrisome

taking
into
account
the
rooted
context
in
the
region,
derived
from
a
tradition
of
long-standing
dictatorships
and
armed
conflicts,
of
systematic
and
generalized
human

violations.
16
And,
even
more
complicated
is
to
note
that,
besides
selling
or
deploying
surveillance
technologies
as
their
own
business,
companies
are
also
entering
into
partnerships
with
governments
to
implement
such
systems,
normally
with
the
argument
of
security ,
innovation
and
"smart
cities".
17
A
history
of
abuses
and
deficient
regulation
on
surveillance,
particularly
when
it
comes
to
safeguards,
aggravates
the
risks
posed
by
such
technologies
to
the
exercise
of
fundamental
rights.
Most
attempts
to
regulate
biometric
identification
technologies
in
Latin
America
seem
to
be
more
concerned
with
validating
their
implementation
than
with
balancing
their
purpose
with
respect
for
human
rights,
in
clear
contradiction
with
their
international
commitments.
Therefore,
while
specific
regulation
could
be
beneficial
to
strengthen
controls
and
remedy ,
this
will
only
be
possible
when
its
formulation
considers
a
focus
on
preventing
impact
and
risks
to
the
exercise
of
fundamental
rights,
including
notably
privacy
and
non-discrimination.
Procurement
of
advanced
surveillance
tools
by
States
has
thus
become
a
source
of
concern,
as
the
industry
of
spyware
and
malware
tools,
among
others,
has
risen
taking
advantage
of
the
lack
of
proper
legal
frameworks
and
democratic
oversight,
leading
to
calls
for
limiting
the
sale,
transfer
and
use
of
surveillance
tools.
18
In
this
regard,
it
is
crucial
to
take
into
account
the
recommendations
of
the
United
Nations
High
Commissioner
for
Human
Rights
on
the
need
to
control
the
production
and
sale
of
surveillance
systems
that
do
not
respect
human
rights,
as
well
as
to
call
for
a
moratorium
on
those
that
do
not
meet
the
basic
criteria.
19
As
some
of
Alsur
organizations
have
stated
in
a
recent
thematic
hearing
before
the
IACHR,
20
although
there
are
clear
standards
on
the
subject
and
both
the
universal
and
interamerican
systems
have
recognized
the
risk
that
surveillance
technologies
pose
to
human
rights,
given
the
enormous
and
rapid
growth
of
these
technologies
and
the
lack
of
information
and
control,
these
standards
are
insuf ficient
to
prevent
impacts.
There
is
a
pressing
need
to
develop
standards
to
regulate
the
acquisition,
development
and
implementation
of
technologies
with
surveillance
capabilities
with
a
focus
on
prevention,
especially
considering
that
the
evaluation
of
rights
violations
is
always
carried
out
after
they
have
occurred
and
in
many
cases
this
prevents
the
situation
from
being
remedied.

Recommendations
for
the
Global
Digital
Compact
●
Supervise
States
compliance
to
their
international
human
rights
commitments
with
regards
to
the
acquisition
and
deployment
of
surveillance
technologies
emphasizing
the
need
to
comply
with
the
principles
of
necessity ,
legality
and
proportionality
through
case
by
case
analysis.
●
Guide
and
supervise
the
adoption
of
human
rights
based
normative
frameworks
to
limit
the
State's
use
of
surveillance
technologies
with
specific
safeguards
against
abuses,
according
to
the
principles
of
necessity
and
proportionality
and
existing
obligations
regarding
access
to
information
and
transparency .
Such
frameworks
should
include
an
obligation
to
apply
a
moratorium
when
technologies
–
such
as
hacking
tools,
malware,
drones
as
well
as
biometric
technologies
–
don’t
comply
with
basic
human
rights
criteria.
●
Support
the
strengthening
of
judicial
and
oversight
institutions
and
mechanisms,
emphasizing
on
the
need
of
prior
judicial
authorization
for
any
intrusions
to
the
right
to
privacy ,
explicitly
guaranteeing
the
right
to
an
effective
remedy ,
as
well
as
mechanisms
of
transparency
and
accountability
of
States.
Support
the
development
of
the
necessary
capacities
(financial,
human,
technical
and
knowledge)
and
powers
to
effectively
audit,
investigate
and
prosecute
any
abuse
in
the
usage
of
surveillance
technologies
by
State
actors,
this
includes
having
absolute
access
to
any
information,
installation
or
equipment
necessary
to
carry
out
their
functions.
●
Transparency
should
guide
any
State
action
regarding
its
general
surveillance
capabilities,
including
regarding
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
use
of
private
surveillance
technologies
and
safeguard
measures
implemented
to
avoid
abuses.
●
Mandate
the
adoption
of
human
rights
due
diligence
measures
in
the
acquisition
of
surveillance
technologies
in
order
to
assess
and
monitor
potential
human
rights
abuses
and/or
violations
offered
by
the
deployment
of
such
technologies,
applying
a
moratorium
on
technologies
that
don’t
meet
the
basic
criteria.
●
Guarantee
that
mechanisms
and
standards
are
in
place
to
assure
that
the
surveillance
technology
industry
complies
with
their
duty
to
respect
and
protect
human
rights,
no
matter
their
size,
operational
context,
ownership
and
structure,
as
well
to
avoid
causing
or
contributing
to
adverse
human
rights
impacts
from
the
deployment
of
their
systems,
and
address
such
impacts
whenever
they
occur .
●
Stimulate
the
adoption
of
mechanisms
to
prevent
and
mitigate
adverse
human
rights
impacts,
as
well
as
to
monitor
abuses,
within
the
surveillance
technologies’
industry .

The
connectivity
challenge
in
Latin
America
is
still
an
undeniable
reality .
To
date,
less
than
50%
of
the
population
in
Latin
America
and
the
Caribbean
has
fixed
broadband
connectivity ,
and
only
9.9%
have
high-quality
fiber
at
home.
When
thinking
about
rural-urban
connectivity
gaps,
four
out
of
ten
Latin
Americans
living
in
rural
areas
have
connectivity
options
vis
a
vis
71%
of
the
population
in
urban
areas.
22
Connectivity
gaps
are
a
reflection
of
the
inequity
that
afflicts
the
region.
The
link
between
poverty
and
inequality
has
its
share
in
this
problem,
but
there
are
other
disparities
that
we
must
acknowledge
including
that
the
digital
divide
also
affects
more
women
populations
and
geographically
or
socially
isolated
groups.
23
To
address
these
challenges
and
ensure
universal
access
to
telecommunication
services,
States
must
combine
different
regulatory
initiatives
to
guarantee
the
principles
of
availability ,
affordability
and
accessibility ,
as
established
by
the
International
Telecommunication
Union
(ITU)
24
.
For
this,
telecommunication
administrations
have
increasingly
adopted
Universal
Service
Funds
(USF)
as
a
funding
mechanism
that
is
typically
funded
via
some
form
of
contribution
from
telecommunication
service
providers.
25
This
said,
States
must
protect
the
nature
of
these
funds.
I.e.,
in
Paraguay ,
there
is
documentation
that
such
funds
have
been
used
to
acquire
facial
recognition
cameras
to
be
deployed
in
the
capital
instead
of
actually
being
applied
to
expand
connectivity
to
all.
26
Beyond
internet
access’
key
role
in
the
exercise
of
fundamental
rights
including
freedom
of
expression
(see
section
1.a),
connectivity
becomes
each
day
more
a
necessity
for
the
fulfillment
of
States
obligation
to
guarantee
the
exercise
of
economic,
social
and
cultural
rights.
27
For
this
to
occur ,
connectivity
public
policies
must
go
beyond
the
mere
connection
objective
and
adopt
a
social
justice
and
human
rights
approach.
Although
in
some
countries
of
the
region
there
are
roadmaps
in
place
to
reduce
the
connectivity
gap,
they
focus
mostly
on
maintaining
and
strengthening
the
commercial
activity
of
large
operators.
This
cannot
respond
to
the
full
diversity
of
contexts.
For
instance,
the
poor
infrastructure
for
rural
areas
and
the
often
low
purchasing
power
of
the
people
tend
to
prevent
big
operators
from
investing

in
such
areas.
28
Consequently ,
increasing
connectivity
is
not
only
a
matter
of
expanding
coverage,
it
also
requires
focusing
strategies
to
reduce
inequalities
and
the
search
for
equal
opportunities.
Betting
on
market
solutions
exclusively
foregoes
the
chance
to
create
other
approaches.
Solutions
that
incorporate
community
networks
and
local
providers
should
be
considered,
as
both
options
ensure
links
to
communities
and
a
high
degree
of
contextual
awareness.
It
is
worth
noting
that
schools
are
essential
to
include
when
thinking
about
connectivity
strategies.
The
COVID-19
pandemic
demonstrated
the
need
to
connect
schools:
State
actions
to
strengthen
access
to
the
internet
in
schools
are
necessary .
The
Committee
on
the
Rights
of
the
Child
has
recently
published
General
Comment
No.
25,
which
considers
the
protection
of
children
in
the
digital
environment
to
be
fundamental.
29
This
document
points
out
that
States
must
mobilize,
allocate
and
use
resources
to
ensure
children's
rights
in
the
digital
environment,
including
connectivity
(Paragraph
28).
30
The
document
also
points
out
that
States
parties
"should
not
intentionally
obstruct
or
allow
other
actors
to
obstruct
[...]
mobile
telephone
networks
or
Internet
connectivity
in
any
geographical
area
[...]
in
a
manner
that
may
have
the
effect
of
hindering
children's
access
to
information
and
communication"(Paragraph
54).
31
Finally ,
the
document
states
that
standards
for
digital
educational
technologies
should
ensure
that
the
use
of
such
technologies
is
ethical
and
appropriate
for
educational
purposes
and
does
not
expose
children
to
violence,
discrimination,
misuse
of
their
personal
data,
commercial
exploitation
or
other
infringements
of
their
rights,
such
as
the
use
of
digital
technologies
to
document
their
activities
and
share
this
information
with
their
parents
or
caregivers
without
children's
consent
(Paragraph
103)
32
.
Transversal
to
all
the
above
is
the
State's
duty
to
ensure
net
neutrality .
Currently ,
zero
rating
provisions
in
multiple
Latin
American
markets
are
a
situation
that
needs
to
be
reflected
upon
and
with
the
final
goal
of
securing
diverse
access
to
the
internet
in
the
region
that
allows
local
innovation
to
thrive.
States
must
adopt
a
focus
that
provides
full
and
universal
access
to
the
internet,
rather
than
concentrating
efforts
on
allowing
partial
access
mediated
by
operator
preferences
33
.
Such
approach
must
also
be
adopted
in
schools,
and
avoid
plans
that
only
grant
access
to
State
digital
educational
resources
34
since
it
would
limit
children’ s
ability
to
access
diverse
information.

Moreover ,
full
and
meaningful
connectivity
requires
considering
explicitly
the
problems
faced
by
people
with
disabilities
(PWD).
From
a
human
rights
perspective,
disability
is
associated
with
the
idea
that
it
is
social
and
cultural
barriers
that
prevent
people
from
fully
exercising
their
rights.
This
approach
is
known
as
the
social
model
and
implies
a
paradigm
shift,
in
which
disability
is
no
longer
understood
as
an
individual
attribute
but
rather
the
result
of
an
environment
that
imposes
barriers
and
gives
rise
to
exclusion.
Disability
is,
thus,
a
condition
that
can
disappear
if
such
barriers
are
removed.
The
approach
was
incorporated
by
the
International
Convention
on
the
Rights
of
Persons
with
Disabilities
(2006).
35
The
Convention
includes
accessibility
in
its
Article
No.
9
and
states
that
it
means
ensuring
access
for
persons
with
disabilities
to
their
physical
surroundings,
transport,
information
and
communication
services
and
technologies
on
an
equal
basis
with
others,
as
well
as
other
public
facilities,
in
urban
and
rural
areas.
Although
access
and
accessibility
are
closely
related
in
the
online
sphere,
there
is
a
difference
between
connectivity
and
web
accessibility
that
should
be
highlighted.
The
former
refers
to
internet
access,
meaning
the
possibility
to
log
into
a
network
through
a
device.
The
latter
refers
to
specific
environments,
such
as
websites,
platforms,
or
applications
being
developed
with
criteria
that
enable
access
to
the
greatest
diversity
and
number
of
people
possible,
in
both,
their
programming
and
design,
regardless
of
their
technical
skills
and
types
of
equipment.
Research
carried
out
in
some
Latin
American
countries
showed
that
states
and
companies
should
increase
their
efforts
to
provide
web
accessibility
by
developing
accessible
products
and
services
for
PWD.

Recommendations
for
the
Global
Digital
Compact
●
The
GDC
should
acknowledge
that
providing
connectivity
for
all
is
part
of
States’
obligations
to
guarantee
the
exercise
of
civil
and
political,
as
well
as
economic,
social
and
cultural
rights,
and
provide
that
connectivity
policies
should
be
implemented
considering
a
human
rights
framework
and
a
gender -based
and
social
justice
perspective.
Affirmative
actions
should
be
adopted
to
overcome
gender
digital
divides.
●
The
GDC
should
foster
the
adoption
of
different
regulatory
initiatives
to
guarantee
the
principles
of
availability ,
affordability
and
accessibility
when
it
comes
to
connectivity
policies
and
assure
that
specific
measures
are
implement
to
overcome
urban-rural
and
gender
divides,
respecting
the
self-determination
of
groups
potentially
affected
by
infrastructure
deployment
and
international
commitments
with
prior
consultation
in
case
of
indigenous
areas.
●
Policies
to
advance
connectivity
for
all
must
combine
market-based
with
community-oriented
solutions,
especially
in
rural
areas,
which
includes
measures

More
importantly ,
such

must
not
contribute
to
the
already
dominant
position
of
Global
North
tech
companies,
and
must
consider
open

educational
resources
when
developing
such
plans.

P r o t e c t
d a t a
The
development
and
advancement
of
digital
technologies
has
depended
on
the
massive
collection,
use
and
storage
of
personal
data.
Since
a
broader
use
of
social
media
platforms,
the
Internet
of
Things
(IoT)
and
today
with
Artificial
Intelligence
(AI),
this
reliance
on
personal
data
processing
has
been
increasing
at
an
accelerated
pace.
However ,
the
regulation
and
data
protection
frameworks
implemented
by
the
States
have
not
kept
that
pace,
even
with
the
most
developed
countries
still
lagging
behind.
Moreover ,
progress
towards
strong
personal
data
protection
legislation
has
come
into
tension
with
the
implementation
of
surveillance
technologies,
such
as
facial
recognition
systems
and
the
use
of
spyware
for
State
security
purposes.
These
technologies,
in
addition
to
affecting
privacy ,
also
have
implications
for
the
use
of
public
space
by
restricting
free
movement,
freedom
of
association
and
freedom
of
expression.
Discussions
on
data
protection
frameworks
and
the
rejection
of
the
implementation
of
harmful
technologies
also
take
place
in
a
relationship
of
unequal
power
between
the
owners
of
the
data
with
respect
to
the
States
and
companies.
While
the
former
have
few
claiming
instruments
and
must
necessarily
use
platforms
and
the
Internet
to
access
information,
communicate
and
carry
out
several
of
their
activities,
the
latter
take
advantage
of
these
needs.
At
the
same
time,
it
is
also
important
to
mention
the
power
imbalances
at
the
international
level.
While
citizens
of
countries
in
the
Global
North
enjoy
stronger
data
and
privacy
protection
frameworks,
even
extraterritorially ,
citizens
of
the
global
South
are
subject
to
greater
abuses
by
companies
and
States.
Civil
society
organizations,
for
instance,
have
reported
how
the
personal
data
of
migrants
at
the
borders
of
countries
in
the
Global
North
are
collected
without
proper
safeguards
and
how
their
conditions
are
often
invisibilized
in
regulatory
discussions
at
national
and
international
levels.
37
Similarly ,
technology
companies
take
advantage
of
legislative
and
regulatory
loopholes
to
collect
personal
data
from
countries
in
the
global
South
for
commercial
purposes
and
the
development
of
their
technologies,
including
the
training
of
Artificial
Intelligence
models
–
deepening
geopolitical
inequalities.
The
discussion
on
international
instruments
for
the
fight
against
cybercrime
is
also
a
matter
of
concern.
We
have
observed
the
setback
that
the
adoption
of
the
new
Protocol
to
the
Convention
on
Cybercrime
of
Budapest
may
imply
for
personal
data,
since
access
to
subscriber
data
without
sufficient
safeguards
may
reveal
sensitive
information
about
people's
online
activity
and
may
put
activists,
human
rights
defenders,
political
dissidents
and
journalists
at
risk.
At
a
time
of
discussion
of
a
new
international
convention
to
combat
cybercrime,
data
protection
at
the
international
level
must
be
adequately
safeguarded.
Without
strong
international
instruments
to
balance
these
power
relations,
the
interest
of
security

for
instance:

.
12

and
economic
exploitation
of
data
will
prevail
to
the
detriment
of
individual
and
collective
rights,
especially
those
of
people
from
countries
where
due
regulation
does
not
yet
exist.
Finally ,
considerations
about
the
protection
of
personal
information
that
might
be
used
to
identify
persons
that
wish
to
remain
anonymous
needs
to
be
considered.
Accessing
private
information
like
IP
addresses
and
other
online
identifiers
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
anonymous
online
activity
can
reveal
a
good
deal
about
individuals’
lives—including
sensitive
details
of
their
interests,
beliefs,
relations,
and
intimate
lifestyle—and
thus
such
access
should
be
subject
to
solid
protections.
As
subscriber
information
is
critical
to
identifying
users
and
can
reveal
people’ s
activities,
expressions,
relations,
and
movements,
it
can
be
the
tip
of
the
iceber g,
revealing
a
detailed
profile
about
someone.
The
lack
of
proper
safeguards
when
disclosing
subscriber
information
puts
activists,
human
rights
defenders,
dissidents,
journalists,
and
everyday
people
at
risk.
Subscriber
data,
when
combined
with
content
or
traffic
data
that
is
already
in
the
State's
possession
or
can
be
easily
obtained,
linked
or
referenced,
can
be
used
to
identify
specific
people
involved
in
expressive
activities,
their
location,
and
other
sensitive
information
and
therefore
needs
to
be
protected
in
a
more
proactive
way.
Recommendations
for
the
Global
Digital
Compact
●
The
adoption
of
robust
legislation
on
personal
data
protection
and
access
to
information
should
be
fostered,
as
well
as
standards
to
balance
fundamental
rights
to
privacy ,
freedom
of
expression
and
access
to
information.
●
There
is
a
need
to
rethink
the
idea
of
"informed
consent"
combining
it
with
other
data
protection
principles
in
the
face
of
the
emer gence
of
new
technologies
based
on
data
processing.
Consent
should
not
be
used
as
a
carte
blanche
and
data
protection
principles
such
as
purpose
limitation
and
data
minimization
should
be
considered
minimum
standards
that
cannot
be
waived
or
revoked
at
the
moment
of
giving
consent.
●
Public
and
private
data
controllers
must
follow
obligations
of
loyalty ,
care
and
confidentiality ,
including
the
prohibition
to
use
the
personal
data
for
purposes
unknown
or
different
from
those
motivated
for
its
collection
without
prior
notification
and
meaningful
consent
by
data
subjects
and
the
possibility
for
them
to
deny
such
uses.
This
is
especially
relevant
regarding
biometric
data,
given
its
inalienable
nature
and
the
potential
for
enabling
mass
surveillance.
●
States
must
have
independent
data
protection
authorities
with
due
capacities
to
inspect,
monitor
and
sanction
violations
by
both
private
and
public
entities.
These
authorities
must
have
sufficient
human,
operational,
technical,
knowledge
and
financial
resources
to
be
able
to
effectively
monitor
compliance.
Likewise,
their
independence
and
autonomy
must
be
guaranteed
so
that
their
actions
are
guided
by
the
law
and
not
by
the
influences
of
interested
parties.
●
The
acquisition
and
deployment
of
technologies
by
the
public
sector ,
as
well
as
the
digitalization
of
public
services,
should
be
guided
by
the
principles
of
transparency ,
legality ,
13

necessity
and
proportionality
and
a
broad,
robust
and
comprehensive
human
rights
perspective
that
considers
economic,
social,
cultural
and
environmental
rights.
38
●
The
use
of
big
data
on
public
policies
at
global,
regional,
national
or
local
levels,
including
within
the
UN
bodies,
should
follow
strict
human
rights
and
data
protection
principles
and
should
not
be
implemented
if
there
are
risks
of
abuse,
if
they
involve
processing
of
sensitive
data
or
if
they
may
limit
access
to
essential
public
services.
It
is
advisable
not
to
dismantle
current
developments
in
favor
of
the
right
to
privacy
and
data
protection
for
the
sole
purpose
of
enabling
the
implementation
of
big
data
policy .
On
the
contrary ,
these
protections
should
be
maintained,
strengthened
and
updated.
●
As
freedom
of
expression
mandates
indicate,
the
interception,
collection
and
use
of
personal
information
must
have
a
clear
legal
basis
in
order
to
protect
the
individual
against
arbitrary
or
abusive
interference
with
his
or
her
private
interests.
The
law
should
establish
limits
on
the
nature,
scope
and
duration
of
such
measures,
the
reasons
for
ordering
them,
the
authorities
competent
to
authorize,
execute
and
supervise
them,
and
the
legal
mechanisms
for
challenging
them.
●
Legal
surveillance
of
communications
should
be
carried
out
only
when
necessary
and
proportional.
There
must
be
ways
to
control
and
monitor
the
use
of
these
tools.
Any
excess
should
be
sanctioned.
●
States
must
establish
specific
controls
for
access
to
databases
and
their
use
for
the
identification
of
individuals,
for
example,
under
judicial
authorization
in
criminal
cases,
which
in
turn
must
be
based
on
certain
more
serious
crimes.
●
States
must
adopt
legislative,
administrative
and
other
measures
with
high
standards
for
the
protection
of
personal
data
and
human
rights
in
general;
specifically ,
in
relation
to
cross-border
criminal
investigations.
Criminal
procedural
safeguards
must
be
respected,
including
the
provision
of
prior
judicial
authorization
for
access
to
subscriber
data,
the
establishment
or
preservation
of
strong
privacy
safeguards
and
increased
levels
of
privacy
protection,
etc.
The
UN
should
foster
the
highest
protection
standards
on
this
matter
and
guide
implementation
by
member
States.
●
Service
providers
should
train
their
employees
and
develop
robust
security
protocols.
They
should
also
be
trained
in
human
rights
impact
assessment,
checking
the
legality ,
proportionality
and
local
context
of
cross-border
direct
cooperation
requests.

a r t i f i c i a l
i n t e l l i g e n c e
Artificial
Intelligence
(AI)
characteristics
such
as
high
complexity ,
autonomous
behavior ,
the
need
for
large
amounts
of
data
to
operate
and
opacity
can
negatively
affect
several
fundamental
rights
such
as
privacy ,
freedom
of
expression,
access
to
justice,
among
others.
The
impacts
on
human
rights
in
the
use
of
AI
have
already
been
acknowledged
in
various
resolutions
at
the
international
level.
The
recent
UN
Human
Rights
Council
Resolution
A/HRC/RES/48/4
on
the
right
to
privacy
in
the
digital
age
39
has
delineated
some
of
the
risks
of
adopting
AI
for
the
exercise
of
human
rights,
which
occur
"primarily
when
[AI]
is
employed
for
identification,
tracking,
profiling,
facial
recognition,
behavioral
prediction,
and
for
establishing
scores
for
individuals."
40
The
Resolution
establishes
that
States
must
respect
human
rights
when
it
comes
to
implementing
such
systems
and
adopt
preventive
measures
and
remedies
for
violations
and
abuses
of
the
right
to
privacy ,
especially
of
women,
children,
and
people
in
vulnerable
conditions.
In
a
similar
vein,
the
report
by
the
UN
High
Commissioner
for
Human
Rights,
Michelle
Bachelet,
points
to
the
serious
risks
to
privacy
posed
by
the
use
of
AI
tools.
41
According
to
Bachelet,
profiling,
the
automation
of
decision-making
and
machine
learning
technologies
have
a
major
impact
on
the
right
to
privacy
and
several
other
associated
rights
in
at
least
four
specific
sectors:
police
forces
and
investigations,
national
security ,
criminal
justice,
and
border
controls.
According
to
the
former
High
Commissioner ,
these
systems
add
further
opacity
that
prevents
true
State
accountability
for
violations
in
areas
that
have
historically
suffered
from
a
lack
of
transparency .
The
use
of
AI
in
remote
biometric
recognition
(facial
and
emotion
recognition)
is
also
severely
criticized
by
the
report,
as
it
impairs
"people's
ability
to
live
their
lives
unobserved
and
resulting
in
a
direct
negative
effect
on
the
exercise
of
the
rights
to
freedom
of
expression,
peaceful
assembly
and
association,
and
freedom
of
movement.
In
Latin
America,
there
is
an
alarming
trend
of
increasing
use
of
AI
systems-
in
many
cases
used
in
sensitive
areas
of
public
policy
such
as
to
provide
State
services
without
proper
public
debate
or
specific
rules
limiting
their
use,
having
serious
impacts
on
the
exercise
of
human
rights.
42
The
implementation
of
automated
facial
recognition
technology
in
public
spaces
has
also
increased
in
the
region
with
little
safeguards
and
transparency
considerations,
thus
allowing
for
the
continuous
and
ubiquitous
re-identification
and
de-anonymisation
of
citizens
and
subjecting
them
to
constant
surveillance.

Although
the
developments
related
to
the
implementation
of
AI
were
dominated
by
private
initiatives,
the
public
sector
already
plays
an
important
role
in
encouraging
the
use
of
AI
technologies
either
from
a
regulatory
perspective
with
the
development
of
AI
strategies
that
incentives
their
development
and
deployment,
44
or
from
an
implementation
perspective
by
directly
acquiring,
developing
or
adopting
them.
45
In
many
cases,
this
incentive
comes
at
the
expense
of
States'
international
human
rights
obligations
and
best
practices
in
terms
of
transparency ,
oversight
and
public
accountability .
46
The
adoption
of
these
systems
by
States
often
foregoes
transparent
bidding
processes,
and
public-private
alliances
are
based
on
agreements
with
companies,
without
adequate
guarantees
that
the
necessary
measures
have
been
taken
to
mitigate
and
remedy
any
violations
of
fundamental
rights
or
that
less
harmful
options
have
been
considered
to
address
a
given
issue.
Furthermore,
neither
in
the
case
of
private
or
own
system
developments,
there
are
no
sufficiently
implemented
transparency
and
review
measures
for
automated
decisions
47
.
Research
conducted
by
Derechos
Digitales
on
the
use
of
these
systems
to
provide
State
services,
such
as
those
linked
to
social
interventions
in
Chile,
justice
administration
in
Colombia,
job
allocation
in
Brazil,
and
public
health
management
in
Uruguay ,
shows
that
most
initiatives
process
personal
information,
including
sensitive
information,
without
sufficient
guarantees
for
data
subjects,
including
in
terms
of
meaningful
consent.
In
this
context,
they
are
forced
into
relationships
with
actors
widely
unknown
to
them
in
order
to
exercise
social
and
economic
rights
such
as
social
security ,
the
right
to
work,
the
right
to
healthcare,
and
access
to
justice.
48
Considering
the
issues
outlined,
there
is
a
pressing
need
for
a
human
rights
based
regulation
of
the
development
and
implementation
of
AI
systems
as
a
regulatory
approach
is
essential
to
strengthen
the
coercive
capacity
needed
to
address
concrete
violations
derived
from
the
implementation
of
AI
systems.
49
While
our
analysis
shows
that
data
privacy
laws
are
often
the
main
source
of
control
to
prevent
abuses,
they
are
still
not
sufficiently
mature
in
most
countries
to
be
applied
to
such
complex
contexts
and
sometimes
they
fall
short
in
offering
specific
protections
against
the
impacts
of
AI.

UNESCO
Recommendation
on
Ethics
and
AI,
50
approved
by
its
193
member
states,
is
a
key
reference
in
advancing
contextually-sensitive
regulation
on
AI
and
further
agreements
on
the
matter
should
be
built
from
such
a
basis.
Recommendations
for
the
Global
Digital
Compact
●
Reinforce
all
stakeholders’
obligation
to
respect
human
rights
within
the
development
and
deployment
of
AI
systems,
expressly
emphasizing
that
the
promotion
of
non-discrimination
and
diversity
must
be
addressed
throughout
the
entire
life
cycle
of
IA
systems,
from
their
design
to
their
implementation
and
evaluation.
Such
obligation
should
include
the
need
to
respect
the
principles
of
legality ,
necessity
and
proportionality
and
provisions
mandating
the
conduct
of
human
rights
impact
assessments
prior
to
the
development,
acquisition
or
deployment
of
AI
systems
should
be
advanced
considering
particular
regional
contexts.
Assessments
should
consider
a
holistic
and
integrated
conception
of
human
rights,
taking
into
consideration
the
economic,
social,
cultural,
and
environmental
rights
and
paying
special
attention
to
the
potential
impacts
on
vulnerable
groups
and
individuals,
including
women,
children
and
adolescents,
persons
with
disabilities,
and
the
elderly ,
as
well
as
potential
structural
impacts
on
the
increase
of
pre-existing
inequalities.
●
Encourage
effective
multi-stakeholder
and
multidisciplinary
participation
in
decision-making
during
the
full
life-cycle
of
AI
systems,
including
their
design,
development,
acquisition,
deployment,
evaluation
and
monitoring,
as
well
as
the
production
of
human
rights
impact
assessments,
through
specific
recommendations,
as
well
specific
considerations
regarding
the
need
for
affirmative
actions
to
guarantee
inclusion
of
historically
marginalized
groups
in
decision-making
processes.
Considering
persisting
digital
divides,
offline
mechanisms
should
be
considered
to
complement
online
access
to
information
and
consultation
processes.
●
Encourage
and
guide
the
establishment
of
monitoring
and
control
mechanisms:
Develop
standards
for
periodic
mechanisms
for
evaluation,
monitoring
and
accountability
throughout
the
IA
life
cycle.
It’s
important
to
incorporate
sustained
external
evaluations
in
the
different
stages
of
implementing
the
public
policy ,
to
foster
the
detection
and
correction
of
errors,
particularly
as
regards
emer ging
situations
that
have
not
been
contemplated
in
the
design
stages.
●
In
relation
to
the
principles
of
transparency
and
publicity ,
clear
obligations
must
be
established
regarding
the
publication
reporting
and
evaluation
mechanisms
implemented
by
providers,
which
must
include
information
about
identified
risks/abuses,
transparency
about
who
are
the
actors
involved,
how
the
system
is
developed,
what
data
are
used,
among
other
important
aspects;
planned
mitigation
or
remediation
measures,
as
well
as
concrete
justifications
for
the
continuation
or
discontinuation
of
ongoing
initiatives.

●
UN
and
intergovernmental
bodies
should
observe
such
all
above
recommendations
and
adopt
specific
participation,
human
rights
impact
assessments
and
accountability
mechanisms
regarding
their
own
processes
for
standard
development,
financial
support
mechanisms
and
direct
development,
acquisition
and
deployment
of
AI
systems.
●
Encourage
collaboration
between
more
advanced
economies
and

in
regions
such
as
Latin
America
to
foster
development
of
skills,
breach
knowledge
gaps,
enhance
local
industry ,
and
focus

of
human
necessities
from
an
inclusive,
human-centric
and
rights-respecting
perspective.
Discourage
development
of
technologies
that
create
risks
for
human
rights,
such
as
surveillance
technologies.
