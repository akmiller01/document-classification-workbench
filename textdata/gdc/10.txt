Equity 2030: Building an Equitable Future for All
Rising to the 2030 Agenda and Our Common Agenda by closing the gender equity
1
gap
in technology, data, and financing solutions
In November 2022, the world’ s population reached 8 billion, presenting the international community with
a unique window of opportunity to empower women and girls and create a world of equal opportunities.
There is still much work to be done to ensure all 8 billion people on the planet can exercise their rights
and choices and realize their full potential.
While
the
exponential
growth
of
digital
technologies
continues,
this
growth
is
not
equitable,
and
consequently , neither are the benefits of the digital revolution.
Currently ,
there
is
a
significant
gap
in
gender -inclusive
digital
innovation,
which
can
be
attributed
to,
among
other
things,
a
lack
of
women’ s
inclusion
in
various
stages
of
the
design
and
development
of
digital
solutions,
as
well
as
inadequate
investment
in
research
and
innovation
in
women-centric
digital
solutions.
A
large
body
of
evidence
suggests
that
design
in
technology
is
often
“male-centric”
by
“default”
2
.
Reports
show
that
women-centric
technology
companies
receive
only
3%
of
all
digital
health
funding
3
 .
A
study
from
2018
showed
that
only
20%
of
healthcare
venture
capitalists
had
ever
funded
a
women’ s
healthcare
company
4
.
Gender
bias
in
the
adoption
of
customer
technology
results
in
overlooking
the
barriers
faced
by
women
in
the
adoption
of
technology ,
including
geographical
and
cultural
limitations.
The
lack
of
women’ s
inclusion
in
training
algorithm
decisions
leads
to
erroneously
amplifying
male
data,
rendering
women
statistically
invisible.
In
healthcare,
gender -biased
technology
can
lead
to
delayed
or
incorrect diagnosis and treatment.
Furthermore,
gender
inequity
in
the
design
of
digital
solutions
makes
many
virtual
spaces
unsafe
for
women
and
girls.
The
alarming
prevalence
of
online
violence
against
women
further
deprives
them
of
the
ability to safely participate and maintain a digital presence.
Digital
solutions
can
be
the
great
equalizer
to
disrupt
inequality .
Yet,
progress
cannot
be
achieved
without
gender -equitable
and
women-centric
solutions.
Women
and
girls
are
not
a
niche
–
they
represent
half
of
the
world's
population.
To
be
gender -inclusive,
digital
technologies
and
solutions
must
address
their
needs.
The
Global
Digital
Compact
can
set
the
principles
for
designing
gender -transformative
digital
solutions
and
establish
the
normative
approach
for
digital
development
that
ensures
equitable
access
and
utilization.

Gender equity is the process of being fair to women and men. To ensure fairness, strategies and measures must often be available to compensate for women’s 
historical and social disadvantages that prevent women and men from otherwise operating on a level playing field. Equity leads to 
equality

The development of technological solutions and policymaking should:
-
Integrate
gender  equity in design
at all stages;
-
Incorporate
gender
equity
in
data
,
including
while
developing
algorithms,
training
data
sets,
establishing data security , and in the adoption of customer technologies;
-
Secure
equitable
financing
to
design,
develop
and
produce
women-centric
digital
solutions,
including in the area of wellbeing, healthcare and education.
Building
on
the
2030
Agenda
for
Sustainable
Development,
the
Programme
of
Action
of
the
International
Conference
on
Population
and
Development,
and
the
UN
Secretary
General’ s
“Our
Common
Agenda”
and
“Roadmap
for
Digital
Cooperation”,
we
note
the
following
core
principles
and
actions
that
should
be
taken to allow us to collectively achieve gender equity in digital technologies:
1 .
Ensuring gender equity in the design of all digital solutions at all stages.
Gender -inclusive
design
is
an
essential
step
towards
gender
equity .
The
Global
Digital
Compact
should
promote
a
gender -transformative
approach
5
in
the
design
of
digital
solutions
as
part
of
a
continuum
towards
gender
equity .
This
would
include
promoting
policies
and
regulations
that
ensure
gender -inclusive
technologies
through
gender
parity
in
data
sets,
customer
technology
adoption,
algorithm decisions, as well as data training and security – all following the
Do No Harm
principle.
Including
women
in
user
testing
and
explicitly
identifying
their
concerns,
including
for
safety ,
is
an
essential
part
of
gender
equity
in
design.
As
such,
the
recognition
and
integration
of
technology-facilitated gender -based violence prevention and protection tools is critical.
It
is
also
important
to
eliminate
gender
bias
in
machine-readable
data
sets
that
result,
for
example,
in
unequal
labeling
of
men
and
women’ s
images,
and
differential
outcomes.
Securing
a
diverse,
gender -inclusive
group
of
end-users
from
different
contexts
is
critical
to
ensuring
an
applicable
and
contextual solution.
At
the
same
time,
a
global
alliance
of
key
actors
is
required
to
ensure
that
digital
technology
is
not
only
gender
equitable,
but
that
through
gender
equity
in
design,
digital
solutions
are
making
tangible
progress
in advancing gender equality and women’ s empowerment.

Close
the
gap
in
data
on
gender-equity
in
digital
solutions
and
women-centric
digital solutions.
The
Global
Digital
Compact
should
promote
and
facilitate
the
process
whereby
all
relevant
actors
have
metrics
and
mechanisms
to
identify ,
record
and
report
disaggregated
data
on
gender
equity
in
digital
solutions design, as well as on women-centric digital solutions and relevant investments.
Diversity ,
equity
and
fairness
have
not
always
been
prioritized
in
digital
solutions,
and
the
evidence
base
available
is
limited.
6
Data
revealing
the
existence
of
inequalities
can
be
used
to
further
galvanize
action
towards
the
achievement
of
the
Sustainable
Development
Goals.
Currently ,
data
on
digital
solutions
addressing
the
inclusion
of
women
in
data
sets
and
women-centric
solutions
is
so
marginal
and
of
such
poor quality that it perpetuates a cycle of insuf ficient evidence, exacerbating existing biases.
Quality
data
is
needed
to
track
and
monitor
progress,
and
ensure
that
agreed
upon
objectives
are
met.
Where
data
does
not
exist,
it
must
be
created
by
collective
inputs
from
all
stakeholders,
with
careful
consideration
made
to
the
possible
limitations
and
biases
of
data
sets.
Building
a
solid
foundation
of
evidence
is
a
complex
process
requiring
multiple
studies
and
the
engagement
of
a
wide
range
of
population groups.
5
Data
collection
should
be
anchored
in
safe
and
ethical
principles,
including
instances
where
personal
data
may be mined for malicious actions through, for example, digital solutions on Internet of Things.
Human
rights-based
approaches
are
central
to
ensure
that
efforts
are
made
to
address
the
gap
on
gender -equity in digital solutions and women-centric design solutions.
3 .
Facilitate investment across all digital solution processes and value chains
The
Global
Digital
Compact
endeavors
to
accelerate
the
shift
in
investment
distribution
towards
gender -inclusive
and
women-focused
digital
solutions,
and
away
from
gender -biased
digital
solutions,
including so-called “gender neutral” digital solutions that receive disproportionately lar ger investments.
Current
investments
in
women-centric
solutions
and
technology
companies
developing
such
solutions
are
meager .
Data
on
investments
in
gender -inclusive
digital
solutions
are
hard
to
identify
due
to
a
lack
of
reporting and available metrics.
The
scarcity
of
investment
in
gender -equitable
digital
solutions
is
a
self-reinforcing
circle.
Global
inequity
in
the
health
sector
leads
to
significant
financial
losses,
and
is
greatly
affected
by
non-medical
drivers.
7
Representative
data
sets
are
among
the
powerful
levers
that
can
be
used
to
disrupt
the
status
quo
and
also
require
more
funding.
The
economic
interconnectedness
of
these
issues
underline
how
various
stakeholders can play an important role in closing the equity gap.
Integrating
gender
perspectives
into
policies
would
strengthen
the
case
for
national
and
international
financial investments in the implementation and enforcement of regulatory tools and mechanisms.

This
is
a
call
for
action
to
ensure
the
Global
Digital
Compact
advances
equity
through
digital
technology ,
helping
build
an
inclusive,
sustainable
and
gender -equal
future
where
women’ s
voices
are
heard, their needs are met, and their potential is fulfilled.
Gender inequity in digital solutions may not be intentional, but our ef forts to address the bias should be.
