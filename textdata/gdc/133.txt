I N T R O D U C T I O N
The
United
Nations
Global
Digital
Compact
(GDC)
was
developed
in
response
to
the
growing
recognition
of
the
importance
of
digital
technology
in
achieving
the
United
Nations
Sustainable
Development
Goals
(SDGs)
(United
Nations,
2023)
The
rapid
advancement
of
digital
technology
has
created
new
opportunities
for
development
and
innovation,
but
it
has
also
created
new
risks
and
challenges
(Geist
&
Lohn,
2018)
(Horowitz
&
Scharre,
2021).
In
recent
years,
there
has
been
growing
concern
about
the
negative
impact
of
digital
technology
on
society,
including
the
erosion
of
privacy,
the
spread
of
misinformation,
and
the
exacerbation
of
inequalities
(Ogbette
et
al.,
2019)
(Hassan
&
Hitchen,
2020).
At
the
same
time,
there
has
been
increasing
recognition
of
the
potential
of
digital
technology
to
transform
societies
and
achieve
the
SDGs.
In
response
to
these
challenges
and
opportunities,
the
United
Nations
launched
the
High-level
Panel
on
Digital
Cooperation
in
2018.
The
panel
was
tasked
with
identifying
ways
to
maximize
the
benefits
of
digital
technology
while
minimizing
the
risks
and
challenges.
The
panel's
final
report,
released
in
2019,
called
for
the
development
of
a
new
global
framework
for
digital
cooperation,
which
would
include
the
development
of
a
global
Commitment
on
Digital
Cooperation
(United
Nations,
2019).
The
United
Nations
Global
Digital
Compact
(GDC)
is
a
call
to
action
for
the
global
community
to
work
together
to
ensure
that
digital
technology
is
used
for
the
greater
good.
The
GDC
is
a
joint
effort
by
the
United
Nations,
the
private
sector,
civil
society,
and
academia
to
harness
the
power
of
digital
technology
to
advance
the
United
Nations
Sustainable
Development
Goals
(SDGs)
and
ensure
a
better
future
for
all.
The
UN
Secretary
General’s
Tech
Envoy
provides
frameworks
for
collaboration
to
ensure
that
digital
technology
is
used
to
achieve
a
more
sustainable,
equitable,
and
prosperous
world.
The
UN
GDC
consultation
process
is
an
important
part
of
the
development
of
the
initiative.
The
purpose
of
the
consultation
process

6
is
to
gather
input
from
stakeholders
around
the
world
to
help
shape
the
GDC
framework.
The
consultation
process
is
open
to
all
stakeholders,
including
governments,
the
private
sector,
civil
society,
academia,
and
individuals.
The
UN
GDC
consultation
process
aims
to
achieve
several
objectives.
First,
it
seeks
to
identify
key
priorities
for
action
to
ensure
that
digital
technology
is
used
to
achieve
the
SDGs.
Second,
it
aims
to
identify
the
most
effective
ways
to
leverage
digital
technology
to
address
the
challenges
facing
the
world.
Third,
it
seeks
to
identify
the
key
stakeholders
that
need
to
be
involved
in
the
GDC
and
how
they
can
work
together
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
initiative.
To
achieve
these
objectives,
the
GDC
consultation
process
is
designed
to
be
inclusive
and
participatory.
It
is
open
to
all
stakeholders,
regardless
of
their
background
or
location.
The
process
includes
a
range
of
activities,
such
as
online
surveys,
virtual
roundtables,
and
workshops.
These
activities
are
designed
to
gather
input
from
stakeholders
on
a
range
of
topics,
such
as
the
role
of
digital
technology
in
achieving
the
SDGs,
the
risks
and
opportunities
associated
with
digital
technology,
and
the
best
practices
for
ensuring
that
digital
technology
is
used
for
the
greater
good.
The
GDC
consultation
process
provides
an
opportunity
for
stakeholders
to
share
their
perspectives
and
ideas
on
how
digital
technology
can
be
used
to
address
the
challenges
facing
the
world.
The
GDC
process
and
an
opportunity
for
the
global
community
to
incorporate
ideas
from
the
global
south.
The
input
gathered
through
the
GDC
consultation
process
could
play
an
important
role
in
shaping
the
GDC
framework
and
other
treaties.
The
UN
GDC
framework
would
outline
the
key
priorities
for
action,
the
stakeholders
that
need
to
be
involved,
and
the
best
practices
for
ensuring
that
digital
technology
is
used
to
achieve
the
SDGs.
The
framework
also
provides
guidance
for
stakeholders
and
UN
member-states
on
how
to
work
together
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
initiative.

Regulating
AI
In
the
first
session
we
discussed
Regulating
Artificial
Intelligence
(AI)
with
Scott
Timcke,
Senior
Research
Associate
Research
ICT
Africa;
Samantha
Msipa,
AI
Research
Fellow,
Research
ICT
Africa;
and
Jackie
Akello,
AI
Research
Fellow,
Research
ICT
Africa.
A.I.
has
the
potential
to
transform
many
industries
and
aspects
of
our
daily
lives.
As
A.I.
becomes
more
advanced
and
integrated
into
society,
there
are
growing
concerns
about
its
regulation,
as
well
as
its
ethical
implications.
Currently,
there
are
various
initiatives
at
national
and
international
levels
to
regulate
A.I.
At
the
international
level,
the
OECD
has
developed
principles
for
the
regulation
of
AI,
and
the
United
Nations
has
initiated
discussions
on
the
development
of
international
norms
and
standards
for
AI.
In
the
EU,
the
General
Data
Protection
Regulation
(GDPR)
has
provisions
related
to
AI
and
automated
decision-making
(European
Parliament,
2020).
At
the
national
level,
countries
such
as
the
United
States,
Canada,
and
the
UK
have
established
government
agencies
to
oversee
the
development
and
use
of
AI,
while
others,
such
as
China
and
South
Korea,
have
developed
national
AI
strategies
(United
States
Government,
2021)
(The
Government
of
the
Republic
of
Korea,
2019).
Many
countries
are
also
developing
their
own
regulations
and
guidelines
for
AI.
For
example,
in
2020,
the
European
Commission
released
its
white
paper
on
AI,
which
proposed
new
regulations
for
AI
in
the
EU,
including
a
requirement
for
high-risk
AI
systems
to
be
tested
and
certified
before
they
can
be
deployed.
Ethical
considerations
are
also
a
major
concern
in
the
regulation
of
AI
(Bostrom,
2009).
Many
organizations
and
experts
have
developed
ethical
principles
for
the
development
and
use
of
AI,
such
as
the
IEEE
Global
Initiative
on
Ethics
of
Autonomous
and
Intelligent
Systems,
which
has
developed
a
set
of
ethical
principles
for
A.I.,
including
transparency,
privacy,
and
accountability
(“The
IEEE
Global
Initiative
on
Ethics
of
Autonomous
and
Intelligent
Systems,”
2019).
Many
industries
are
also
developing
their
own
standards
for
the
development

8
and
use
of
AI,
such
as
the
Partnership
on
AI,
which
includes
major
tech
(Big
Tech)
companies
such
as
Google,
Microsoft,
and
Facebook,
and
has
developed
a
set
of
principles
for
the
responsible
development
and
use
of
A.I.
(Google,
n.d.).
A.I.
developers
are
taking
a
self-regulatory
approach,
developing
their
own
codes
of
conduct
and
guidelines
for
the
use
of
A.I.
For
example,
Microsoft
has
developed
a
set
of
A.I.
principles
that
govern
the
development
and
use
of
A.I.
within
the
company
(Microsoft,
n.d.).
The
regulation
of
AI
is
a
complex
and
evolving
issue
that
requires
a
multi-stakeholder
approach.
As
AI
continues
to
develop
and
become
more
integrated
into
society,
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
it
is
developed
and
used
in
a
responsible
and
ethical
manner.
The
development
of
regulations
and
ethical
principles
for
AI
will
be
crucial
in
achieving
this
goal.
More
importantly,
as
Big
Tech
companies
advance
their
policy
ideas
using
resources
at
their
disposal,
it
is
essential
that
AI
regulations
capture
the
inputs
and
contributions
of
all
relevant
stakeholders,
including
the
general
public.
Cross-Border
Data
Flows
(CBDF)
In
the
second
session
we
discussed
Cross-Border
Data
Flows
(CBDF)
with
Anupam
Chander,
Professor
of
Law
and
Technology,
Georgetown
University
Law
Center
and
Smriti
Parsheera,
Fellow,
CyberBRICS
Project,
Fundacao
Getulio
Vargas
Law
School,
Brazil.
Cross-border
data
flows
refer
to
the
transfer
of
data
from
one
country
to
another,
which
has
become
increasingly
important
in
today's
interconnected
world
(Meltzer
&
Lovelock,
2018).
The
importance
of
cross-border
data
flows
lies
in
its
ability
to
enable
global
trade,
communication,
and
innovation
(United
Nations
Capital
Development
Fund
et
al.,
2022).
However,
it
also
poses
risks
and
challenges
associated
with
privacy,
security,
and
data
protection
(Li
et
al.,
2022).
The
regulation
of
cross-border
data
flows
is
essential
to
ensure
that
data
is
transferred
in
a
responsible
and
ethical
manner
that
respects
individual
privacy
and
promotes
innovation.
With
the
continued
growth
and
evolution
of
data
flows,
it
will
be
crucial
to
strike
a
balance

9
between
enabling
the
free
flow
of
information
across
borders
and
safeguarding
privacy
and
data
protection.
Regulating
cross-border
data
flows
is
a
complex
issue
that
requires
a
multi-stakeholder
approach,
involving
governments,
businesses,
and
civil
society
(Meltzer
&
Lovelock,
2018).
There
are
several
regulatory
approaches
to
cross-border
data
flows.
Some
countries
may
restrict
data
flows
through
measures
such
as
data
localization
requirements
or
strict
data
protection
regulations
that
apply
to
cross-border
data
transfers.
Other
countries
may
facilitate
data
flows
through
mechanisms
such
as
mutual
recognition
agreements
(Beyleveld
&
Sucker,
2022).
International
agreements
also
regulate
cross-border
data
flows.
For
instance,
the
World
Trade
Organization's
(WTO)
General
Agreement
on
Trade
in
Services
(GATS)
includes
provisions
related
to
the
free
flow
of
information
across
borders
(World
Trade
Organization,
1995).
Additionally,
the
European
Union's
General
Data
Protection
Regulation
(GDPR)
includes
provisions
related
to
cross-border
data
transfers,
including
requirements
for
data
protection
safeguards
and
the
possibility
of
adequacy
decisions
that
allow
for
data
transfers
to
third
countries
that
meet
certain
data
protection
standards
(Voss,
2022).
Emerging
trends
are
also
shaping
the
regulation
of
cross-border
data
flows.
The
rise
of
cloud
computing
and
the
Internet
of
Things
(IoT)
is
increasing
the
volume
of
data
that
is
being
transferred
across
borders
and
making
trade
flow
measurement
more
challenging
(Coyle
&
Nguyen,
2009)
(Berry
&
Reisman,
2012).
The
growing
use
of
artificial
intelligence
(AI)
is
raising
new
questions
about
the
protection
of
personal
data.
There’s
a
strong
relationship
between
cross-border
data
flows
and
A.I
(Meltzer,
2018).
A.I.
technologies
rely
on
vast
amounts
of
data
to
learn
and
improve
their
performance,
and
this
data
often
needs
to
be
sourced
from
different
countries
and
regions
(Jones,
2023).
Cross-border
data
flows
enable
the
transfer
of
this
data,
making
it

10
possible
for
countries.
companies
and
researchers
to
access
the
information
they
need
to
develop
and
improve
AI
systems.
Cross-border
data
flows
also
raise
important
ethical
and
legal
issues
related
to
A.I.
For
instance,
there
are
concerns
about
the
protection
of
personal
data
and
the
privacy
of
individuals
whose
data
is
being
used
to
train
AI
models
(Humerick,
2018).
Data
flows
that
involve
the
transfer
of
sensitive
or
personal
information
may
require
additional
safeguards
to
ensure
that
this
information
is
protected
against
unauthorized
access,
use,
or
disclosure.
There
is
growing
interest
in
establishing
ethical
guidelines
and
principles
for
A.I.,
which
may
also
be
affected
by
cross-border
data
flows
(AI
HELG,
2019).
These
guidelines
may
include
provisions
related
to
transparency,
accountability,
and
human
rights,
which
may
require
careful
consideration
when
data
is
transferred
across
borders.
As
the
use
of
AI
continues
to
grow
and
evolve,
it
is
likely
that
cross-border
data
flows
will
become
even
more
important
for
the
development
and
implementation
of
these
technologies.
As
such,
it
will
be
critical
to
ensure
that
data
flows
are
managed
in
a
responsible
and
ethical
manner
that
promotes
innovation
and
economic
prosperity
while
also
protecting
individual
privacy
and
data
protection.

M E T H O D O L O G Y
We
adopted
a
Socratic
dialogue
methodology
of
questioning
and
critical
thinking
in
facilitating
the
dialogue
sessions.
Our
choice
of
methodology
was
based
on
the
goal
of
the
dialogue
sessions
which
was
to
encourage
participants
to
explore
the
topic
more
deeply
and
consider
different
viewpoints.
We
also
chose
this
methodology
because
of
the
small
size
of
the
group
and
the
time
available.
During
dialogue
sessions,
the
facilitator
asked
a
series
of
questions
that
encouraged
participants
to
think
about
their
own
ideas
and
beliefs,
whilst
considering
each
other’s
view
point.
Our
aim
was
to
promote
mutual
understanding
and
capture
the
numerous
viewpoints
to
make
a
more
inclusive
input
to
the
UN
GDC
consultation
process.
The
Socratic
approach
encouraged
critical
thinking
and
reflection
among
participants.
Through
questioning
and
exploration,
the
Socratic
approach
uncovered
underlying
assumptions
and
values
that
shaped
some
of
the
participants'
perspectives,
and
was
a
valuable
insight
in
our
research.
The
dialogue
sessions
were
facilitated
by
two
(2)
DEF
members
and
staff.
The
facilitators
ensured
that
there
was
enough
time
for
each
speaker,
and
that
the
session
was
on
track
with
the
stated
agenda
and
timeline.
The
facilitators
used
open-ended
questions
to
encourage
participants
to
explore
their
own
and
each
other's
assumptions,
values,
and
beliefs.
The
facilitators
summarized
responses
to
help
participants
clarify
their
thoughts
and
ensure
that
everyone
is
on
the
same
page.
The
dialogue
sessions
were
conducted
virtually
via
zoom,
a
cloud-based
video
conferencing
and
online
meeting
platform
because
of
accessibility
and
cost.
Virtual
dialogue
sessions
can
be
accessed
from
anywhere,
which
makes
it
easier
for
participants
from
different
geographic
locations
with
different
schedules
to
participate.
Virtual
dialogue
sessions
allow
hosts
to
record
and
archive
conversations
for
later
review,
making
it
easier
to
document
and
research
discussions.
Zoom
in
particular
offered
additional
features
such
as
virtual

12
backgrounds,
hand
raising,
and
polling,
which
enhanced
the
experience
of
the
virtual
dialogue
session.
An
online
survey
was
conducted
during
the
virtual
dialogue
sessions
on
zoom.
The
survey
questions
were
presented
to
participants
of
the
dialogue
session
using
zooms
poll
features.
Participants
were
encouraged
to
complete
the
survey
while
the
dialogue
session
continued.
Facilitators
and
panelists
were
encouraged
not
to
take
part
in
the
survey
to
gain
broad-based
opinions
from
less
informed
citizens.
The
survey
questions
took
on
a
dichotomous
format
which
asked
respondents
to
choose
between
two
options,
"yes"
or
"no."
The
survey
questions
for
both
sessions
were
split
into
2
categories.
The
first
centered
around
defining
the
core
principles
or
values
that
all
stakeholders
(governments,
companies,
civil
society
etc)
adhere
to.
The
second
set
of
questions
centered
around
what
policymakers
should
do
to
specifically
achieve
the
identified
core
principles.
The
survey
questions
were
designed
following
a
secondary
data
analysis
of
existing
sources
such
as
OECD
AI
Principles
(OECD,
2019).
The
dialogue
session
included
participants
and
respondents
such
as
the
President
of
Nigeria
Association
of
Computing
Students
(NACOS),
other
students
studying
computer
related
courses
in
tertiary
institutions;
and
leading
private
sector
professionals
who
are
members
of
DEF.
The
agenda
for
the
first
dialogue
session
captured
discussions
on:
●
AI
and
“National
security”
●
AI
ethics
(including
personhood)
●
Economic
liability
as
a
result
of
AI
diffusion
●
Inclusivity
in
the
global
governance
of
AI.
The
agenda
for
the
second
dialogue
session
captured
discussions
on:
●
Cross
border
data
flow
and
“National
security”
●
Cross
border
data
flow
and
“Trade”
●
Cross
border
data
flow
and
“National
competitiveness”
●
Cross
border
data
flow
and
the
“Digital
divide”.

Limitations
of
the
Methodology
Used
Virtual
dialogue
sessions
sometimes
come
with
technical
difficulties,
lack
of
nonverbal
cues
and
issues
with
internet
connectivity.
We
experienced
all
this
while
hosting
the
two
virtual
events.
Panelists
of
both
events
included
non-Nigerians.
However
all
the
panelists
of
the
first
dialogue
session
were
Africans
with
Research
ICT
Africa
based
in
South
Africa.
The
panelists
of
the
second
dialogue
session
weren’t
African
but
drew
a
lot
of
examples
from
their
native
India
which
is
quite
relatable
to
the
African
context.
Lastly,
the
participants
weren’t
given
a
secluded
time
to
answer
the
survey
questions
during
the
dialogue
sessions,
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
an
awkward
silence.
Nonetheless,
this
gave
respondents
ample
time
to
answer
questions
at
their
pace.
The
survey
questions
were
based
on
research
and
analysis
of
institutions
based
in
the
global
north.

F I N D I N G S
Dialogue
Sessions
The
first
dialogue
session
on
regulating
A.I.
consisted
of
discussions
that
included
criticism
for
neo-colonial
approaches
to
economic
development
in
Africa.
The
first
dialogue
session
panelists
included
Scott
Timcke,
Senior
Research
Associate
Research
ICT
Africa;
Samantha
Msipa,
AI
Research
Fellow,
Research
ICT
Africa;
and
Jackie
Akello,
AI
Research
Fellow,
Research
ICT
Africa.
The
panelists
agreed
that
data
is
the
fuel
of
A.I.
systems,
and
postulated
that
activities
and
investments
by
Big
Tech
corporations
in
Africa
enriches
the
global
north
and
may
not
lead
to
long-term
economic
prosperity
for
Africa.
Given
Nigeria’s
population
boom
and
the
potential
data
users
and
producers,
Scott
Timcke
of
Research
ICT
Africa
believes
“Africa
is
well-positioned
to
become
more
aggressive
bargainers
around
technology,
technology-transfer
and
access
to
markets”
because
Big
Tech
is
driven
by
data
collected
from
people.
He
discussed
the
social
inequalities
created
by
Big
Tech
and
how
it
is
related
to
the
global
inequality
between
the
North
and
the
South.
Jackie
Akello
of
Research
ICT
Africa
stressed
that
whilst
data
is
being
harvested
and
owned
by
Big
Tech,
“the
communities
from
which
data
is
being
harvested
do
not
get
anything
from
this
data.
In
fact
they
do
not
have
access
to
their
data”.
She
discussed
the
need
for
community
agency
and
ownership.
She
recommended
that
Africans
should
explore
“the
benefits
communities
get
from
their
data,
given
its
economic
benefits
and
power”,
adding
that
“communities
from
which
data
is
harvested
lack
power
over
their
own
data;
and
cannot
even
use
it
for
their
social
needs”.
We
discussed
the
need
to
educate
the
public
about
the
usefulness
and
power
of
the
data
they
produce
towards
encouraging
agency
and
collective
bargaining.
We
agreed
and
postulated
that
data
justice
within
the
frameworks
of
economics
and
power,
and
indigenous
data
sovereignty
are
crucial
aspects
that
we
must
consider
while
regulating
A.I.

15
We
discussed
practical
frameworks
for
regulating
A.I.
in
Nigeria
and
agreed
that
data
regulation
and
A.I.
regulation
can’t
be
conveniently
separated.
Scott
Timcke
recommended
that
regulation
of
A.I.
and
data
“cannot
be
seen
as
discrete
separate
regulatory
projects,
and
have
to
be
seen
as
one”.
We
agreed
and
postulated
that
regulating
A.I.
in
Africa
sooner
rather
than
later
is
very
important
because
of
historical
antecedents
that
have
seen
Africa
susceptible
to
exploitation
and
extractivism
in
scenarios
where
African
states
didn’t
haven’t
have
the
appropriate
institutional
and
regulatory
apparatus
in
place.
We
discussed
community-based
data
sovereignty
and
possible
frameworks
for
community
ownership
of
data,
citing
examples
such
as
user-unions
that
use
collective
bargaining
to
negotiate
ownership
of
their
data.
We
agreed
that
experimentation
is
necessary
to
arrive
at
a
fair
negotiated
settlement
between
the
markets,
the
public,
government,
civil
society,
academia
etcetera.
We
discussed
data
deserts.
We
agreed
and
postulated
that
developing
data
localisation
provisions
could
facilitate
the
development
of
local
data
infrastructure
and
telecoms
industry.
We
discussed
the
potential
for
the
state
to
be
an
active
player
in
the
market
to
overcome
market
failures.
Scott
Timcke
recommended
that
African
“states
start
to
build
and
subsidize
networks”.
We
discussed
developing
standardization
and
harmonization
as
a
means
to
establishing
a
Digital
Single
Market
(DSM).
We
discussed
protectionism
within
digital
trade
in
Africa
and
globally.
We
disagreed
about
the
protectionist
approach
that
could
be
pursued
by
authoritarian
governments
within
the
framework
of
national
data
sovereignty.
Finally,
we
agreed
and
postulated
that
data
sovereignty
is
about
the
public
articulating
their
need
for
better
agency
over
the
way
technology
evolves
in
their
society.
The
second
dialogue
session
on
cross-border
data
flows
centered
on
striking
a
balance
between
boosting
economic
development
through
data
localisation
and
civil
liberties
through
the
constructive
development
of
digital
autonomy.
We
discussed
the
use
of
economic
justifications

16
for
data
localisation
across
developing
countries.
We
discussed
the
use
of
security
justifications
for
data
localisation
by
technology
advanced
nations.
We
agreed
and
postulated
that
digital
trade
generally
is
empowering.
We
discussed
the
reduction
of
cost
through
free
flow
of
data.
We
discussed
the
EU’s
data
protection
directive
and
agreed
that
such
a
digital
framework
would
be
very
empowering
for
Africans.
Smriti
Parsheera
of
Fundacao
Getulio
Vargas
Law
School
advised
that
“just
having
your
data
stored
locally
within
servers
in
your
country
does
not
automatically
mean
that
you
would
have
more
capacity
for
A.I.
research,
that
you
would
have
access
to
the
data”.
Anupam
Chander
of
Georgetown
university
recommended
“controlling
the
data
wherever
it
sits”.
We
agreed
and
postulated
that
what
mattered
the
most
was
access
to
data.
We
agreed
and
postulated
that
data
localisation
empowers
the
state
more
than
individuals
within
the
country.
We
discussed
exploring
bottom-up
models
that
provide
data
autonomy.
We
discussed
the
possibility
of
using
agency
as
a
lever
or
justification
for
data
localisation
or
access.
We
agreed
and
hypothesized
that
agency
is
an
ideal
justification
because
it
empowers
the
individual,
even
though
practicality
may
be
very
difficult.
Smriti
Parsheera
of
Fundacao
Getulio
Vargas
Law
School
noted
that
“smaller
nations,
more
developed
Sweden
and
Finland
have
some
examples
where
they
do
have
statutory
stewardship
models
and
are
testing
them.
But
in
contexts
like
ours
which
are
more
complex,
institutional
capacities
are
more
complicated,
people
are
not
so
organized,
probably
not
as
organized
as
they
should
be,
it
is
more
complex
to
think
of
empowerment
in
the
grassroots”.
We
discussed
adopting
metrics
to
track
the
social
impact
of
Big
Tech
as
a
more
effective
way
of
demanding
for
economic
development.
We
discussed
the
use
of
technology
to
fill
institutional
gaps
in
developing
countries
with
weak
state
structures,
which
could
lead
to
new
sets
of
power
relations
that
pose
a
threat
to
civil
liberty.
We
agreed
and
hypothesized
that
states
need
to
adopt
a
peculiar
approach
towards
striking
the
balance
between
economic
development
and
civil
liberties.

Surveys
During
and

A N A L Y S I S
To
carry
out
an
analysis
of
the
data
gathered
from
our
dialogue
sessions
the
data
was
transcribed,
and
coded.
Recurring
themes
were
identified
to
draw
meaningful
conclusions.
The
dialogue
sessions
were
transcribed
and
code
co-occurrence
analysis
was
applied
to
analyze
the
frequency
and
patterns
of
certain
code
fragments/themes
appearing
together
in
the
transcript.
First,
a
thematic
analysis
was
done
to
identify
code
fragments
that
will
be
analyzed.
This
was
done
by
identifying
key
words
and
phrases
that
are
relevant
to
the
topics
of
interest.
Once
code
fragments/themes
were
identified,
an
analysis
involving
counting
the
number
of
times
each
pair
of
code
fragments/themes
appeared
together
in
the
transcript
was
carried
out.
This
count
was
represented
in
a
matrix,
where
each
row
and
column
represents
a
code
fragment
and
the
value
at
each
cell
represents
the
number
of
times
the
two
code
fragments
or
themes
appear
together.
The
resulting
matrix
was
analyzed
using
network
analysis
to
visualize
the
relationships
between
code
fragments
as
a
network.
The
networks
were
illustrated
using
a
Sankey
diagram
which
visualizes
the
proportional
quantity
of
flow
between
variables
(code
fragments)
within
a
network.
Key
insights
gained
from
the
code
co-occurrence
analysis
was
used
to
develop
hypotheses
and
could
support
further
analysis.
The
findings
show
that
the
people
engaged
during
the
dialogue
session
on
the
Regulation
of
A.I.
were
mostly
concerned
about
Data
Management.
Other
overarching
themes
during
the
dialogue
session
included
globalization
and
global
politics;
power
dynamics;
community
and
socioeconomic
empowerment;
regulation
and
uncertainty.
Although
data
localisation
from
the
perspective
of
economic
development
within
neocolonialism
was
well
highlighted,
further
analysis
shows
that
the
ultimate
concern
is
economic
settlements
within
global
political
and
socioeconomic
frameworks.

The
analysis
shows
that
the
people
engaged
during
the
dialogue
session
on
the
Cross-Border
Data
Flow
(CBDF)
were
mostly
concerned
about
Power
Dynamics,
Data
Privacy
and
Business
Development.
Participants
agreed
on
themes
of
data
localisation
and
de-centralisation.
Technological
and
operational
capabilities
required
for
data
localisation
and
de-centralisation
were
key
themes
of
discussion
respectively.
The
analysis
highlighted
global
trade,
global
politics
and
international
regulation
as
factors
influencing
data
localisation.
Political
anxiety
and
civil
liberties
within
local
contexts
featured
as
key
concerns
for
participants
when
considering
data
localisation
and
data
ownership.
Participants
were
anxious
about
data
privacy
and
information
security
in
general,
including
misinformation.
Business
and
economic
development
featured
as
key
themes
which
influence
data
localisation
and
decentralization.
Analysis
shows
that
business
and
industry
development;
cost-effectiveness;
and
data
access
are
important
themes
to
consider
alongside
data
privacy
and
global
politics
when
thinking
about
cross-border
data
trade.
Interestingly,
the
analysis
showed
that
participants
were
interested
in
data
access
for
indigenous
businesses,
and
not
necessarily
local
data
storage.
Analysis
points
to
the
need
for
more
critical
thinking
and
research
to
answer
questions
such
as
“How
do
we
use
indigenous
resources
for
indigenous
development?”,
“How
do
we
go
about
data
localisation/
decentralization
cost
effectively?”,
“Should
data
localisation
regulations
stipulate
higher
obligations
for
entities
with
a
certain
user
base
and
a
certain
revenue,
whilst
excluding
small
and
medium
enterprises?”.
Further
research
is
needed
to
assist
policymakers
and
relevant
stakeholders
in
navigating
the
relationship
between
decentralization
and
ownership
within
the
relevant
socioeconomic
and
power
dynamics.

Significant
relationships
or

between
the
variables
measured
in
the
survey
were
also
explored.
Analysis
showed
a
significantly
positive
correlation
between

C O N C L U S I O N
The
input
gathered
through
the
consultation
process
shows
that
people
are
mostly
concerned
about
their
personal
data,
economic
empowerment,
local
and
mostly
global
power
dynamics,
critical
thinking
and
regulation.
The
Nigerian
state
needs
to
negotiate
a
fair
settlement
between
local
and
the
international
stakeholders;
starting
by
being
able
address
data
autonomy
while
implementing
reforms
aimed
at
addressing
market
failures.
The
Nigerian
state
needs
to
address
local
power
dynamics
that
threaten
civil
liberties
in
the
online
space.
According
to
the
UN
Conference
on
Trade
and
Development’s
UNCTAD’s
Digital
Economy
Report
2019,
“The
United
States
and
China
account
for
75%
of
all
patents
related
to
blockchain
technologies,
50%
of
global
spending
on
the
Internet
of
Things
(IoT)
and
more
than
75%
of
the
cloud
computing
market”
(United
Nations
Publications,
2019).
New
technological
advances
are
leaving
developing
countries
marginalized
in
the
digital
world.
Indeed,
data
is
being
dominated
by
global
digital
platforms
and
its
wealth
is
in
the
hands
of
a
few.
Taxation
is
not
a
bad
thing
either,
in
Sirimanne’s
estimation,
because
“if
you
are
a
company
making
money
in
my
country
then
you
should
be
paying
taxes
in
my
country.”
60%
of
Google’s
profits
are
created
outside
the
US,
yet
ninety
per
cent
of
their
taxes
are
paid
within
the
US.
Altogether,
findings
and
analysis
point
to
the
need
for
more
critical
thinking
and
research
to
address
negotiations
for
de-centralisation
and
data
localisations
within
various
power
dynamics
and
socioeconomic
settlements.
Towards
understanding
and
defining
core
principles
which
are
unique
to
the
Nigerian
context,
and
to
address
issues
associated
with
power
dynamics
and
civil
liberties,
Civil
Society
Organisations
(CSO)
were
asked
to
participate
in
a
survey.
To
understand
the
actions
policymakers
could
take
in
promoting
economic
empowerment
through
an
enabling
environment,
a
survey
was
conducted
with
4
leading
Entrepreneurial
Support
Organisations
(ESO).
The
results
can
be

R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S
Following
the
dialogue
sessions
and
the
key
themes
highlighted
by
analysis
such
as
economic
and
community
empowerment;
data
privacy
and
anonymity;
research,
regulation,
and
governance,
DEF
recommends
the
following
principles
and
actions
to
be
taken
by
policymakers
for
A.I.
and
CBDF:
Core
Principles
1.
A.I.
systems
shouldn’t
collect,
store,
or
use
personal
days
without
an
individual's
consent.
2.
A.I.
systems
should
be
designed
and
implemented
in
a
way
that
aligns
with
ethical
principles
such
as
respect
for
human
dignity
and
the
protection
of
human
rights.
3.
AI
systems
should
be
transparent
in
operations,
and
open
to
scrutiny
and
explanation.
4.
Regulation
of
A.I.
should
be
transparent
and
accessible
to
the
public,
including
details
about
the
purposes,
methods,
and
outcomes
of
A.I.
systems.
5.
The
development
of
AI
skills
and
languages
should
be
inclusive
and
accessible
to
all
individuals,
regardless
of
their
social,
economic,
or
educational
background.
6.
Data
should
be
adequately
protected
when
it
is
transferred
across
borders.
7.
Individuals
should
be
informed
about
the
transfer
of
their
data
across
borders.
8.
The
development
of
constructive
frameworks
that
guarantee
digital
community-based
data
stewardship,
autonomy
and
freedom
should
be
encouraged.
9.
Reforms
that
address
market
failures
and
the
digital
divide
should
be
encouraged
to
foster
indigenous
participation
in
the
A.I.
market.
10.
Organizations
should
be
accountable
for
their
data
transfer
practices,
comply
with
applicable
laws
and
regulations,
and
have
appropriate
procedures
in
place
to
respond
to
any
privacy
or
security
incident.

33
Policymaker
actions
1.
Policymakers
should
create
regulations
and
standards
to
ensure
that
AI
systems
are
developed
and
used
in
a
responsible
and
ethical
manner.
2.
Regulations
should
cover
issues
such
as
transparency,
accountability,
fairness,
and
safety.
3.
Policymakers
should
establish
independent
oversight
bodies
to
monitor
the
development
and
use
of
AI
systems,
to
ensure
that
they
comply
with
the
regulations
and
standards
that
have
been
set
4.
Policymakers
should
foster
collaboration
between
the
private
sector,
research
institutions,
and
civic
society
to
ensure
that
AI
is
developed
in
a
way
that
benefits
society
as
a
whole.
5.
Policymakers
should
invest
in
research
to
better
understand
the
potential
risks
and
benefits
of
AI;
and
develop
new
technologies
and
approaches
that
can
help
mitigate
6.
Policymakers
should
encourage
cross-border
cooperation
between
countries
to
promote
the
secure
and
free
flow
of
data
while
guaranteeing
the
protection
of
individual
privacy,
national
security
interests,
and
local
economic
development.
7.
Policymakers
should
establish
certification
and
accreditation
frameworks
that
enable
organizations
to
demonstrate
compliance
with
cross-border
data
transfers
laws.
8.
Policymakers
should
demand
regular
audits,
transparency
reports,
and
public
disclosures
that
ensure
organizations
are
held
accountable
for
their
data
processing
activities,
and
that
individuals
are
provided
with
clear
information
about
how
their
data
is
being
used.
9.
Policymakers
should
conduct
extensive
research
that
leads
to
better
settlements
within
existing
economic
and
political
arrangements.
10.
Policymakers
together
with
international
stakeholders
should
develop
key
metrics
that
track
the
economic
and
social
impact
of
Big
Tech
in
developing
countries
like
Nigeria.
