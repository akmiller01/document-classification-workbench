Switzerland should adopt a more open approach. There is insufficient access to platform data and little understanding of how it works. Platforms are an important source of information, especially for young people, and influence the opinion-forming process. There should be a balance between state and private actors. Switzerland can do more in terms of building and building digital and data literacy. It is important to take international proposals as a basis for the domestic policy debate. A report by OFCOM and the FDFA envisages a code of conduct for dataspace operators. A high level of cybersecurity is the basis for successful digital transformation. There is a need to invest in the training and integration of young professionals to reduce the skills gap. It is important to fluidly articulate the link between the local community and our involvement in the digital world. It can also be used to enrich the discussions in these forums. It will be the main topic of the plenary sessions and workshops at Swiss IGF 2022."

Governments should adopt a national data constitutionalism rooted in human rights to guide all sectors of the economy and society.

The Life Institute organized a virtual consultation to offer recommendations on artificial intelligence (AI) governance. Participants were asked for feedback on six prompts related to the GDC. The first round of the virtual consultation received 93 principle proposals. The second round of feedback will be open from March 1st to March. The UN has a unique role in the AI governance space. There is a need for an agreement on several types of procedures on incident reporting, de-escalation, auditing of AI-enabled military systems, non-proliferation, and strategic stability. Independent third parties should be given a mandate to test systems. Mark and Mark participated in the Virtual Consultation on AI governance principles. They agree that AI systems should be designed and deployed in a way that allows people to understand when they are being used and how they were developed and trained. They also agree on transparency and explainability of AI systems. The UN should focus on the preservation and protection of human dignity over economic development. There are challenges in harnessing AI systems in a manner that minimizes harms to individuals. The EU considers four categories of risk (unacceptable risk, high risk limited risk, and minimal risk)."

The use of surveillance tools violate human rights, including the right to privacy, freedom of assembly and association, and the right of expression. They can be harmful to vulnerable or marginalised communities, such as women and LGBT groups. They should be aware of their rights. This call has been backed by seven former and current UN Special Rapporteurs and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. They want to adopt and enforce a legal framework requiring transparency in acquisition and use of surveillance technologies by both public actors and private surveillance companies. They also want to ensure that all private companies domiciled in their countries are required to act responsibly and are held liable for adverse human rights impacts. They are also demanding that the public oversight boards oversee and approve the new surveillance technologies. 9. Implement procurement standards restricting contracts for surveillance technology to only those private surveillance companies that respect human rights in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and have not facilitated or contribute to human rights. 11.

ARTICLE 19 believes it is essential to take a human rights-based approach to the principles and commitments to be set out in the GDC. In 2022, there were 187 instances of Internet disruptions in 35 countries by both States and companies to block, or throttle access to the Internet. The GDC must address the problem of the digital divide and support progress towards achieving meaningful and inclusive connectivity for all. It must affirm the relevance of universal and meaningful connectivity as a fundamental enabler of human rights. The application of human rights to technology needs to be mainstreamed well beyond the content layer. The relationship between technology and the right to freedom of expression and other relevant human rights goes beyond the world wide web, social media platforms, and applications. In Brazil, ARTICLE 19 championed the right of expression, right to information, freedom to association and assembly in the run up to the 2022 general elections. In Mexico, Pegasus spyware was illegally used to conduct surveillance on journalists and human rights defenders in Mexico. ARTICLE 19 is pushing for the proposed Cybercrime treaty to include strong human rights safeguards. They call on governments to ban the use of biometric technologies for untargeted mass surveillance in public and publicly accessible spaces."

Al Sur has produced evidence on different surveillance tools used by public authorities. Websites should provide tools for reporting, for reporting and for responding to victims. There is a need to develop standards to regulate the use of these technologies to prevent violations of human rights. States must comply with the principles of availability, accessibility, affordable, and accessibility established by the International Union and the Universal Service Fund.

The most developed countries are still lagging behind behind. Citizens in the North enjoy strong data and privacy protection.  Access Now.org has a joint statement on how to act on people on the move. It says access to information should be subject to solid protections.
